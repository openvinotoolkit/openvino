# Enabling tests in OpenVINO CI

Each component contains own documentation for writing and extending tests.
If you want to get more information about it please read the documentation for interested [component](../../src/README.md).

This guide oversees existed OpenVINO CIs.

OpenVINO has two types of public CIs: [Azure](../../.ci/azure) and [GitHub Actions](../../.github/workflows).

 * [GitHub Actions](../../.github/workflows) is used for building and testing OpenVINO on different platforms and software combinations. Find more information in the [OpenVINO GitHub Actions overview document](./ci/github_actions/overview.md).
 * [Azure](../../.ci/azure) **_is being deprecated_** in favour of the GitHub Actions.
