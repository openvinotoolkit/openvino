How to Implement Custom GPU Operations
======================================

   :description: Learn the details of custom kernel support for the GPU device to
                 enable operations not supported by OpenVINO.


To enable operations not supported by OpenVINO™ out of the box, you may need an extension for OpenVINO operation set, and a custom kernel for the device you will target. This article describes custom kernel support for the GPU device.

The GPU codepath abstracts many details about OpenCL. You need to provide the kernel code in OpenCL C and an XML configuration file that connects the kernel and its parameters to the parameters of the operation.

There are two options for using the custom operation configuration file:

* Include a section with your kernels into the automatically-loaded ``<lib_path>/cldnn_global_custom_kernels/cldnn_global_custom_kernels.xml`` file.
* Call the ``ov::Core::set_property()`` method from your application with the ``"CONFIG_FILE"`` key and the configuration file name as a value before loading the network that uses custom operations to the plugin:

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Python
      :sync: py

      .. doxygensnippet:: docs/snippets/gpu/custom_kernels_api.py
        :language: python
        :fragment: [part0]

   .. tab-item:: C++
      :sync: cpp

      .. doxygensnippet:: docs/snippets/gpu/custom_kernels_api.cpp
        :language: cpp
        :fragment: [part0]


All OpenVINO samples, except the trivial ``hello_classification``, and most Open Model Zoo demos
feature a dedicated command-line option ``-c`` to load custom kernels. For example, to load custom operations for the classification sample, run the command below:

.. code-block:: cpp

   $ ./classification_sample -m <path_to_model>/bvlc_alexnet_fp16.xml -i ./validation_set/daily/227x227/apron.bmp -d GPU
   -c <absolute_path_to_config>/custom_layer_example.xml

The configuration file is expected to follow the ``.xml`` file structure
with a node of the type ``CustomLayer`` for every custom operation you provide.

The definitions described in the sections below use the following notations:

.. code-block:: c

   #define INPUT0_DIMS_SIZE 4
   #define INPUT0_DIMS (int []){ 1,96,55,55, }

.. _example-kernel:

Example Kernel
##############

.. code-block:: c

   #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_khr_fp16 : enable
   __kernel void example_relu_kernel(
       const __global INPUT0_TYPE*  input0,
             __global OUTPUT0_TYPE* output)
   {
       const uint idx  = get_global_id(0);
       const uint idy  = get_global_id(1);
       const uint idbf = get_global_id(2); // batches*features, as OpenCL supports 3D nd-ranges only
       const uint feature = idbf % OUTPUT0_DIMS[1];
       const uint batch   = idbf / OUTPUT0_DIMS[1];
       //notice that pitches are in elements, not in bytes!
       const uint in_id  = batch*INPUT0_PITCHES[0] + feature*INPUT0_PITCHES[1]   + idy*INPUT0_PITCHES[2]  + idx*INPUT0_PITCHES[3]  + INPUT0_OFFSET;
       const uint out_id = batch*OUTPUT0_PITCHES[0] + feature*OUTPUT0_PITCHES[1]  + idy*OUTPUT0_PITCHES[2]  + idx*OUTPUT0_PITCHES[3]  + OUTPUT0_OFFSET;

       INPUT0_TYPE value = input0[in_id];
       // neg_slope (which is non-zero for leaky ReLU) is put automatically as #define, refer to the config xml
       output[out_id] = value < 0 ? value * neg_slope : value;
   }

.. _debugging-tips:

.. note::
   As described in the previous section, all items such as the ``INPUT0_TYPE`` are actually defined as OpenCL (pre-)compiler inputs by OpenVINO for efficiency reasons. See the `Debugging Tips <#debugging-tips>`__ below for information on debugging the results.

Debugging Tips
##############

**Using ``printf`` in the OpenCL™ Kernels**.
To debug the specific values, use ``printf`` in your kernels.
However, be careful not to output excessively, which
could generate too much data. The ``printf`` output is typical, so
your output can be truncated to fit the buffer. Also, because of
buffering, you actually get an entire buffer of output when the
execution ends.

For more information, refer to the `printf Function <https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/sdk/1.2/docs/man/xhtml/printfFunction.html>`__.
