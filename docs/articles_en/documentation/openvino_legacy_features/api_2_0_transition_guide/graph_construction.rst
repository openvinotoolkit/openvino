Model Creation in OpenVINO™ Runtime
=====================================


.. meta::
   :description: Model creation in OpenVINO™ Runtime API 2.0 is performed with 
                 nGraph engine that has been preserved in the new API and its 
                 namespace has been changed to 'ov'.


OpenVINO™ Runtime with API 2.0 includes the nGraph engine as a common part. The ``ngraph`` namespace has been changed to ``ov``, but all other parts of the ngraph API have been preserved.

The code snippets below show how to change the application code for migration to API 2.0.
