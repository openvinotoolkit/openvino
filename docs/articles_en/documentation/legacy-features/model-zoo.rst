.. note::

   Since the deprecation of Open Model Zoo, OpenVINO has significantly extended its presence on the
   `Hugging Face <https://huggingface.co/OpenVINO>`__ model repository. It is currently
   the recommended source of optimized OpenVINO IR models.

Open Model Zoo for OpenVINO™ toolkit delivers a wide variety of free, pre-trained deep learning
models and demo applications that provide full application templates to help you implement deep
learning in Python, C++, or OpenCV Graph API (G-API).

Models, demos and full documentation are available in the
`Open Model Zoo GitHub repo <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo>`__
and licensed under Apache License Version 2.0.

Browse through over 200 neural network models, both
`public <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/blob/master/models/public/index.md>`__ and from
`Intel <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/blob/master/models/intel/index.md>`__, and pick the right one for your solution.
Types include object detection, classification, image segmentation, handwriting recognition,
text to speech, pose estimation, and others. The Intel models have already been converted
to work with OpenVINO™ toolkit, while public models can easily be converted using the
:doc:`OpenVINO Model Conversion API <../../openvino-workflow/model-preparation>` utility.

Open Model Zoo offers a
`comprehensive set of demos <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/blob/master/demos/README.md>`__ that you can adapt for implementing specific deep
learning scenarios in your applications.
