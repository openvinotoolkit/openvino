AI Models verified for OpenVINO™
=====================================

The following is a list of models that have been verified to work with OpenVINO. Note that other
models from OpenVINO-supported frameworks may also work properly but have not been tested.

**AI Models that run on Intel® Core Ultra™ Processors with OpenVINO™ toolkit:**

| The results as of February 25 2025, for OpenVINO version 2025.0.
| The models come from different public model repositories, such as Pytorch Model Zoo and
  HuggingFace; they were executed on the designated hardware with OpenVINO either natively or
  as a backend.
