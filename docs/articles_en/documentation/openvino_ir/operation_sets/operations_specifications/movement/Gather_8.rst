  :description: Learn about Gather-8 - a data movement operation,
                which can be performed on three required input tensors.

**Versioned name**: *Gather-8*

**Category**: *Data movement*

**Short description**: *Gather* operation takes slices of data of the first input tensor according to the indices
specified with the second input tensor and axis from the third input. Semantics of this operation is identical to
TensorFlow `Gather <https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/gather>`__ operation but also includes
support of negative indices.

**Detailed description**

.. code-block:: sh

   output[p_0, p_1, ..., p_{axis-1}, i_b, ..., i_{M-1}, p_{axis+1}, ..., p_{N-1}] =
      data[p_0, p_1, ..., p_{axis-1}, indices[p_0, p_1, ..., p_{b-1}, i_b, ..., i_{M-1}], p_{axis+1}, ..., p_{N-1}]

Where ``data``, ``indices`` and ``axis`` are tensors from first, second and third inputs correspondingly, ``b`` is
the number of batch dimensions. ``N`` and ``M`` are numbers of dimensions of ``data`` and ``indices`` tensors, respectively.
Allowed values for indices are in the range ``[-data.shape[axis], data.shape[axis] - 1]``. If index value exceed allowed
range output data for corresponding index will be filled with zeros (Example 7).

**Attributes**:

* *batch_dims*

  * **Description**: *batch_dims* (also denoted as ``b``) is a leading number of dimensions of ``data`` tensor
    and ``indices`` representing the batches, and *Gather* starts to gather from the ``b`` dimension.
    It requires the first ``b`` dimensions in ``data`` and ``indices`` tensors to be equal.
    If ``batch_dims`` is less than zero, normalized value is used ``batch_dims = indices.rank + batch_dims``.
  * **Range of values**: ``[-min(data.rank, indices.rank); min(data.rank, indices.rank)]`` and ``batch_dims' <= axis'``.
    Where ``batch_dims'`` and ``axis'`` stand for normalized ``batch_dims`` and ``axis`` values.
  * **Type**: *T_AXIS*
  * **Default value**: 0
  * **Required**: *no*

Example 1 with default *batch_dims* value:

.. code-block:: sh

   batch_dims = 0
   axis = 0

   indices = [0, 0, 4]
   data    = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   output  = [1, 1, 5]

Example 2 with non-default *batch_dims* value:

.. code-block:: sh

   batch_dims = 1
   axis = 1

   indices = [[0, 0, 4], <-- this is applied to the first batch
              [4, 0, 0]]  <-- this is applied to the second batch
   indices_shape = (2, 3)

   data    = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],  <-- the first batch
              [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]]  <-- the second batch
   data_shape = (2, 5)

   output  = [[ 1, 1, 5],
              [10, 6, 6]]
   output_shape = (2, 3)


Example 3 with non-default *batch_dims* value:

.. code-block:: sh

   batch_dims = 2
   axis = 2

   indices = [[[0, 0, 4],  <-- this is applied to the first batch, index = (0, 0)
               [4, 0, 0]],  <-- this is applied to the second batch, index = (0, 1)

              [[1, 2, 4],  <-- this is applied to the third batch, index = (1, 0)
               [4, 3, 2]]]  <-- this is applied to the fourth batch, index = (1, 1)
   indices_shape = (2, 2, 3)

   data    = [[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],  <-- the first batch, index = (0, 0)
               [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]],  <-- the second batch, index = (0, 1)

              [[11, 12, 13, 14, 15],  <-- the third batch, index = (1, 0)
               [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]]]  <-- the fourth batch, index = (1, 1)
   data_shape = (2, 2, 5)

   output  = [[[ 1, 1, 5],
               [10, 6, 6]],

              [[12, 13, 15],
               [20, 19, 18]]]
   output_shape = (2, 2, 3)

Example 4 with *axis* > *batch_dims*:

.. code-block:: sh

   batch_dims = 1
   axis = 2

   indices = [[1, 2, 4],  <-- this is applied to the first batch
              [4, 3, 2]]  <-- this is applied to the second batch
   indices_shape = (2, 3)

   data = [[[[ 1,  2,  3,  4], <-- first batch
             [ 5,  6,  7,  8],
             [ 9, 10, 11, 12],
             [13, 14, 15, 16],
             [17, 18, 19, 20]]],

           [[[21, 22, 23, 24], <-- second batch
             [25, 26, 27, 28],
             [29, 30, 31, 32],
             [33, 34, 35, 36],
             [37, 38, 39, 40]]]]
   data_shape = (2, 1, 5, 4)

   output = [[[[ 5,  6,  7,  8],
               [ 9, 10, 11, 12],
               [17, 18, 19, 20]]],

             [[[37, 38, 39, 40],
               [33, 34, 35, 36],
               [29, 30, 31, 32]]]]
   output_shape = (2, 1, 3, 4)


Example 5 with negative *batch_dims* value:

.. code-block:: sh

   batch_dims = -1  <-- normalized value will be indices.rank + batch_dims = 2 - 1 = 1
   axis = 1

   indices = [[0, 0, 4], <-- this is applied to the first batch
              [4, 0, 0]]  <-- this is applied to the second batch
   indices_shape = (2, 3)

   data    = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],  <-- the first batch
              [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]]  <-- the second batch
   data_shape = (2, 5)

   output  = [[ 1, 1, 5],
              [10, 6, 6]]
   output_shape = (2, 3)


Example 6 with negative indices:

.. code-block:: sh

   batch_dims = 0
   axis = 0

   indices = [0, -2, -1]
   data    = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   output  = [1, 4, 5]


Example 7 with indices out of the range:

.. code-block:: sh

   batch_dims = 0
   axis = 0

   indices = [3, 10, -20]
   data    = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   output  = [4, 0, 0]


**Inputs**

* **1**:  ``data`` tensor of type *T* with arbitrary data. **Required.**
* **2**:  ``indices`` tensor of type *T_IND* with indices to gather. 0D tensor (scalar) for indices is also allowed.
  The values for indices are in the range ``[-data.shape[axis], data.shape[axis] - 1]``.
  Negative values of indices indicate reverse indexing from ``data.shape[axis]``. **Required.**
* **3**:  Scalar or 1D tensor ``axis`` of *T_AXIS* type is a dimension index to gather data from. For example,
  *axis* equal to 1 means that gathering is performed over the first dimension. Negative ``axis`` means reverse indexing and
  will be normalized to value ``axis = data.rank + axis``. Allowed values are from ``[-len(data.shape), len(data.shape) - 1]``
  and ``axis' >= batch_dims'``. Where ``axis'`` and ``batch_dims'`` stand for normalized ``batch_dims`` and ``axis`` values. **Required.**

**Outputs**

* **1**: The resulting tensor of type *T* that consists of elements from ``data`` tensor gathered by ``indices``. The shape
of the output tensor is ``data.shape[:axis] + indices.shape[batch_dims:] + data.shape[axis + 1:]``

**Types**

* *T*: any supported type.
* *T_IND*: any supported integer types.
* *T_AXIS*: any supported integer types.
