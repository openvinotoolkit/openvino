                 devices.


This page demonstrates how to use the Benchmark Tool to estimate deep learning inference performance on supported devices.

.. note::

   Use either Python or C++ version, depending on the language of your application.


Basic Usage
####################

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Python
      :sync: python

      The Python ``benchmark_app`` is automatically installed when you install OpenVINO
      using :doc:`PyPI <../../get-started/install-openvino/install-openvino-pip>`.
      Before running ``benchmark_app``, make sure the ``openvino_env`` virtual
      environment is activated, and navigate to the directory where your model is located.

      The benchmarking application works with models in the OpenVINO IR
      (``model.xml`` and ``model.bin``) and ONNX (``model.onnx``) formats.
      Make sure to :doc:`convert your models <../../documentation/legacy-features/transition-legacy-conversion-api/legacy-conversion-api>`
      if necessary.

      To run benchmarking with default options on a model, use the following command:

      .. code-block:: sh

         benchmark_app -m model.xml

   .. tab-item:: C++
      :sync: cpp

      To use the C++ ``benchmark_app``, you must first build it following the
      :ref:`Build the Sample Applications <build-samples>` instructions and
      then set up paths and environment variables by following the
      :doc:`Get Ready for Running the Sample Applications <../openvino-samples>`
      instructions. Navigate to the directory where the ``benchmark_app`` C++ sample binary was built.

      .. note::

         If you installed OpenVINO Runtime using PyPI or Anaconda Cloud, only the
         :doc:`Benchmark Python Tool <benchmark-tool>` is available,
         and you should follow the usage instructions on that page instead.

      The benchmarking application works with models in the OpenVINO IR, TensorFlow,
      TensorFlow Lite, PaddlePaddle, PyTorch and ONNX formats. If you need it,
      OpenVINO also allows you to :doc:`convert your models <../../documentation/legacy-features/transition-legacy-conversion-api/legacy-conversion-api>`.

      To run benchmarking with default options on a model, use the following command:

      .. code-block:: sh

         ./benchmark_app -m model.xml


By default, the application will load the specified model onto the CPU and perform
inference on batches of randomly-generated data inputs for 60 seconds. As it loads,
it prints information about the benchmark parameters. When benchmarking is completed,
it reports the minimum, average, and maximum inference latency and the average throughput.

You may be able to improve benchmark results beyond the default configuration by
configuring some of the execution parameters for your model. For example, you can
use "throughput" or "latency" performance hints to optimize the runtime for higher
FPS or reduced inference time. Read on to learn more about the configuration
options available with ``benchmark_app``.





Configuration Options
#####################

The benchmark app provides various options for configuring execution parameters.
This section covers key configuration options for easily tuning benchmarking to
achieve better performance on your device. A list of all configuration options
is given in the :ref:`Advanced Usage <advanced-usage-benchmark>` section.

Performance hints: latency and throughput
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The benchmark app allows users to provide high-level "performance hints" for
setting latency-focused or throughput-focused inference modes. This hint causes
the runtime to automatically adjust runtime parameters, such as the number of
processing streams and inference batch size, to prioritize for reduced latency
or high throughput.

The performance hints do not require any device-specific settings and they are
completely portable between devices. Parameters are automatically configured
based on whichever device is being used. This allows users to easily port
applications between hardware targets without having to re-determine the best
runtime parameters for the new device.

If not specified, throughput is used as the default. To set the hint explicitly,
use ``-hint latency`` or ``-hint throughput`` when running ``benchmark_app``:

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Python
      :sync: python

      .. code-block:: console

         benchmark_app -m model.xml -hint latency
         benchmark_app -m model.xml -hint throughput

   .. tab-item:: C++
      :sync: cpp

      .. code-block:: console

         ./benchmark_app -m model.xml -hint latency
         ./benchmark_app -m model.xml -hint throughput

.. note::

   It is up to the user to ensure the environment on which the benchmark is running is optimized for maximum performance. Otherwise, different results may occur when using the application in different environment settings (such as power optimization settings, processor overclocking, thermal throttling).
   When you specify single options multiple times, only the last value will be used. For example, the ``-m`` flag:

   .. tab-set::

      .. tab-item:: Python
         :sync: python

         .. code-block:: console

            benchmark_app -m model.xml -m model2.xml

      .. tab-item:: C++
         :sync: cpp

         .. code-block:: console

            ./benchmark_app -m model.xml -m model2.xml



Latency
--------------------

Latency is the amount of time it takes to process a single inference request.
In applications where data needs to be inferenced and acted on as quickly as
possible (such as autonomous driving), low latency is desirable. For conventional
devices, lower latency is achieved by reducing the amount of parallel processing
streams so the system can utilize as many resources as possible to quickly calculate
each inference request. However, advanced devices like multi-socket CPUs and modern
GPUs are capable of running multiple inference requests while delivering the same latency.

When ``benchmark_app`` is run with ``-hint latency``, it determines the optimal number
of parallel inference requests for minimizing latency while still maximizing the
parallelization capabilities of the hardware. It automatically sets the number of
processing streams and inference batch size to achieve the best latency.

Throughput
--------------------

Throughput is the amount of data an inference pipeline can process at once, and
it is usually measured in frames per second (FPS) or inferences per second. In
applications where large amounts of data needs to be inferenced simultaneously
(such as multi-camera video streams), high throughput is needed. To achieve high
throughput, the runtime focuses on fully saturating the device with enough data
to process. It utilizes as much memory and as many parallel streams as possible
to maximize the amount of data that can be processed simultaneously.

When ``benchmark_app`` is run with ``-hint throughput``, it maximizes the number of
parallel inference requests to utilize all the threads available on the device.
On GPU, it automatically sets the inference batch size to fill up the GPU memory available.

For more information on performance hints, see the
:doc:`High-level Performance Hints <../../openvino-workflow/running-inference/optimize-inference/high-level-performance-hints>` page.
For more details on optimal runtime configurations and how they are automatically
determined using performance hints, see
:doc:`Runtime Inference Optimizations <../../openvino-workflow/running-inference/optimize-inference>`.


Device
++++++++++++++++++++

To set which device benchmarking runs on, use the ``-d <device>`` argument. This
will tell ``benchmark_app`` to run benchmarking on that specific device. The benchmark
app supports CPU and GPU devices. In order to use GPU, the system
must have the appropriate drivers installed. If no device is specified, ``benchmark_app``
will default to using ``CPU``.

For example, to run benchmarking on GPU, use:

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Python
      :sync: python

      .. code-block:: console

         benchmark_app -m model.xml -d GPU

   .. tab-item:: C++
      :sync: cpp

      .. code-block:: console

         ./benchmark_app -m model.xml -d GPU


You may also specify ``AUTO`` as the device, in which case the ``benchmark_app`` will
automatically select the best device for benchmarking and support it with the
CPU at the model loading stage. This may result in increased performance, thus,
should be used purposefully. For more information, see the
:doc:`Automatic device selection <../../openvino-workflow/running-inference/inference-devices-and-modes/auto-device-selection>` page.

.. note::

   * If either the latency or throughput hint is set, it will automatically configure streams,
     batch sizes, and the number of parallel infer requests for optimal performance, based on the specified device.

   * Optionally, you can specify the number of parallel infer requests with the ``-nireq``
     option. Setting a high value may improve throughput at the expense
     of latency, while a low value may give the opposite result.

Number of iterations
++++++++++++++++++++

By default, the benchmarking app will run for a predefined duration, repeatedly
performing inference with the model and measuring the resulting inference speed.
There are several options for setting the number of inference iterations:

* Explicitly specify the number of iterations the model runs, using the
  ``-niter <number_of_iterations>`` option.
* Set how much time the app runs for, using the ``-t <seconds>`` option.
* Set both of them (execution will continue until both conditions are met).
* If neither ``-niter`` nor ``-t`` are specified, the app will run for a
  predefined duration that depends on the device.

The more iterations a model runs, the better the statistics will be for determining
average latency and throughput.

Maximum inference rate
++++++++++++++++++++++

By default, the benchmarking app will run inference at maximum rate based on device capabilities.
The maximum inferance rate can be configured by ``-max_irate <MAXIMUM_INFERENCE_RATE>`` option.
Tweaking this value allow better accuracy in power usage measurement by limiting the number of executions.

Inputs
++++++++++++++++++++

The benchmark tool runs benchmarking on user-provided input images in
``.jpg``, ``.bmp``, or ``.png`` formats. Use ``-i <PATH_TO_INPUT>`` to specify
the path to an image or a folder of images. For example, to run benchmarking on
an image named ``test1.jpg``, use:

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Python
      :sync: python

      .. code-block:: console

         benchmark_app -m model.xml -i test1.jpg

   .. tab-item:: C++
      :sync: cpp

      .. code-block:: sh

         ./benchmark_app -m model.xml -i test1.jpg


The tool will repeatedly loop through the provided inputs and run inference on
them for the specified amount of time or a number of iterations. If the ``-i``
flag is not used, the tool will automatically generate random data to fit the
input shape of the model.

see the :ref:`Examples of Running the Tool <examples-of-running-the-tool-python>` section.

.. _advanced-usage-benchmark:

Advanced Usage
####################

.. note::

   By default, OpenVINO samples, tools and demos expect input with BGR channels
   order. If you trained your model to work with RGB order, you need to manually
   rearrange the default channel order in the sample or demo application or reconvert
   your model using model conversion API with ``reverse_input_channels`` argument
   specified. For more information about the argument, refer to When to Reverse
   Input Channels section of Converting a Model to Intermediate Representation (IR).


Per-layer performance and logging
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The application also collects per-layer Performance Measurement (PM) counters for
each executed infer request if you enable statistics dumping by setting the
``-report_type`` parameter to one of the possible values:

* ``no_counters`` report includes configuration options specified, resulting
  FPS and latency.
* ``average_counters`` report extends the ``no_counters`` report and additionally
  includes average PM counters values for each layer from the network.
* ``detailed_counters`` report extends the ``average_counters`` report and
  additionally includes per-layer PM counters and latency for each executed infer request.

Depending on the type, the report is stored to ``benchmark_no_counters_report.csv``,
``benchmark_average_counters_report.csv``, or ``benchmark_detailed_counters_report.csv``
file located in the path specified in ``-report_folder``. The application also
saves executable graph information serialized to an XML file if you specify a
path to it with the ``-exec_graph_path`` parameter.

Default value is determined automatically for a device.Please note that although the automatic selection usually provides a reasonable    performance, it still may be non - optimal for some cases, especially for very small models. See sample's README for more details. Also, using nstreams>1 is inherently    throughput-oriented option, while for the best-latency estimations the number of streams should be set to 1.
                -inference_only         Optional. Measure only inference stage. Default option for static models. Dynamic models are measured in full mode which includes inputs setup stage,    inference only mode available for them with single input data shape only.

More information on inputs
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The benchmark tool supports topologies with one or more inputs. If a topology is
not data sensitive, you can skip the input parameter, and the inputs will be filled
with random values. If a model has only image input(s), provide a folder with images
or a path to an image as input. If a model has some specific input(s) (besides images),
prepare a binary file(s) or numpy array(s) that is filled with data of appropriate
precision and provide a path to it as input. If a model has mixed input types, the
input folder should contain all required files. Image inputs are filled with image
files one by one. Binary inputs are filled with binary inputs one by one.

* On GPU (throughput mode):

  .. tab-set::

     .. tab-item:: Python
        :sync: python

        .. code-block:: sh

           benchmark_app -m omz_models/intel/asl-recognition-0004/FP16/asl-recognition-0004.xml -d GPU -hint throughput

           ./benchmark_app -m omz_models/intel/asl-recognition-0004/FP16/asl-recognition-0004.xml -d GPU -hint throughput


The application outputs the number of executed iterations, total duration of execution,
latency, and throughput. Additionally, if you set the ``-report_type`` parameter,
the application outputs a statistics report. If you set the ``-pc`` parameter,
the application outputs performance counters. If you set ``-exec_graph_path``,
the application reports executable graph information serialized. All measurements
including per-layer PM counters are reported in milliseconds.

An example of the information output when running ``benchmark_app`` on CPU in
latency mode is shown below:

The Benchmark Tool can also be used with dynamically shaped networks to measure
expected inference time for various input data shapes. See the ``-shape`` and
``-data_shape`` argument descriptions in the :ref:`All configuration options <all-configuration-options-python-benchmark>`
section to learn more about using dynamic shapes. Here is a command example for
using ``benchmark_app`` with dynamic networks and a portion of the resulting output:
