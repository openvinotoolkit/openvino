Please visit the tabs below for more information on key performance indicators and workload parameters.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Throughput
      :sync: throughput

      Measures the number of inferences delivered within a latency threshold
      (for example, number of Frames Per Second - FPS). When deploying a system with
      deep learning inference, select the throughput that delivers the best trade-off
      between latency and power for the price and performance that meets your requirements.

   .. tab-item:: Value
      :sync: value

      While throughput is important, what is more critical in edge AI deployments is
      the performance efficiency or performance-per-cost. Application performance in
      throughput per dollar of system cost is the best measure of value. The value KPI is
      calculated as “Throughput measured as inferences per second / price of inference engine”.
      This means for a 2 socket system 2x the price of a CPU is used. Prices are as per
      date of benchmarking and sources can be found as links in the Hardware Platforms (PDF) description below.

   .. tab-item:: Efficiency
      :sync: efficiency

      System power is a key consideration from the edge to the data center. When selecting
      deep learning solutions, power efficiency (throughput/watt) is a critical factor to consider.
      Intel designs provide excellent power efficiency for running deep learning workloads.
      The efficiency KPI is calculated as “Throughput measured as inferences per second / TDP of
      inference engine”. This means for a 2 socket system 2x the power dissipation (TDP) of a CPU is used.
      TDP-values are as per date of benchmarking and sources can be found as links in the Hardware Platforms (PDF) description below.

   .. tab-item:: Latency
      :sync: latency

      This measures the synchronous execution of inference requests and is reported in milliseconds.
      Each inference request (for example: preprocess, infer, postprocess) is allowed to complete before
      the next is started. This performance metric is relevant in usage scenarios where a single image
      input needs to be acted upon as soon as possible. An example would be the healthcare sector where
      medical personnel only request analysis of a single ultra sound scanning image or in real-time or
      near real-time applications for example an industrial robot's response to actions in its environment
      or obstacle avoidance for autonomous vehicles.

   .. tab-item:: Workload Parameters
      :sync: workloadparameters

      The workload parameters affect the performance results of the different models we use for benchmarking.
      Image processing models have different image size definitions and the Natural Language Processing models
      have different max token list lengths. All these can be found in detail in the :doc:`FAQ section <openvino_docs_performance_benchmarks_faq>`.
      All models are executed using a batch size of 1. Below are the parameters for the GenAI models we display.

      * Input tokens: 1024,
      * Output tokens: 128,
      * number of beams: 1

      For text to image:

      * iteration steps: 20,
      * image size (HxW): 256 x 256,
      * input token length: 1024 (the tokens for GenAI models are in English).

The OpenVINO benchmark setup includes a single system with OpenVINO™, as well as the benchmark application installed.
It measures the time spent on actual inference (excluding any pre or post processing) and then reports on the inferences
per second (or Frames Per Second).

OpenVINO™ Model Server (OVMS) employs the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit runtime libraries and exposes a set of
models via a convenient inference API over gRPC or HTTP/REST. Its benchmark results are measured with the configuration of
multiple-clients-single-server, using two hardware platforms connected by ethernet. Network bandwidth depends on both, platforms
and models under investigation. It is set not to be a bottleneck for workload intensity. The connection is dedicated
only to measuring performance.

.. dropdown:: See more details about OVMS benchmark setup

   The benchmark setup for OVMS consists of four main parts:

   .. image:: _static/images/performance_benchmarks_ovms_02.png
      :alt: OVMS Benchmark Setup Diagram

   * **OpenVINO™ Model Server** is launched as a docker container on the server platform and it listens (and answers on)
     requests from clients. OpenVINO™ Model Server is run on the same machine as the OpenVINO™ toolkit benchmark application
     in corresponding benchmarking. Models served by OpenVINO™ Model Server are located in a local file system mounted into
     the docker container. The OpenVINO™ Model Server instance communicates with other components via ports over a dedicated docker network.

   * **Clients** are run in separated physical machine referred to as client platform. Clients are implemented in Python3
     programming language based on TensorFlow* API and they work as parallel processes. Each client waits for a response from OpenVINO™
     Model Server before it will send a new next request. The role played by the clients is also verification of responses.

   * **Load balancer** works on the client platform in a docker container. HAProxy is used for this purpose. Its main role is
     counting of requests forwarded from clients to OpenVINO™ Model Server, estimating its latency, and sharing this information by
     Prometheus service. The reason of locating the load balancer on the client site is to simulate real life scenario that includes
     impact of physical network on reported metrics.

   * **Execution Controller** is launched on the client platform. It is responsible for synchronization of the whole measurement process,
     downloading metrics from the load balancer, and presenting the final report of the execution.
