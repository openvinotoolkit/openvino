System Requirements
===================


.. note::

   Certain hardware (including but not limited to GPU, GNA, and latest CPUs) requires manual
   installation of specific drivers and/or other software components to work correctly and/or
   to utilize hardware capabilities at their best. This might require updates to operating
   system, including but not limited to Linux kernel, please refer to their documentation
   for details. These modifications should be handled by user and are not part of OpenVINO
   installation.

      * Windows 11, 64-bit
      * CentOS 7
      * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, 64-bit

   .. tab-item:: Additional considerations

      * The use of of GPU requires drivers that are not included in the Intel®
        Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit package.
      * A chipset that supports processor graphics is required for Intel® Xeon®
        processors. Processor graphics are not included in all processors. See
        `Product Specifications  <https://ark.intel.com/>`__
        for information about your processor.
      * While this release of OpenVINO supports Ubuntu 20.04, the driver stack
        for Intel discrete graphic cards does not fully support Ubuntu 20.04.
        We recommend using Ubuntu 22.04 when executing on discrete graphics.
      * The following minimum (i.e., used for old hardware) OpenCL™ driver's versions
        were used during OpenVINO internal validation: 22.43 for Ubuntu 22.04, 21.48
        for Ubuntu 20.04 and 21.49 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

.. note::

   OpenVINO Python binaries and binaries on Windows, CentOS 7, and macOS (x86) are built
   with oneTBB libraries, and others on Ubuntu and RedHat systems are built with
   legacy TBB which is released by OS distribution. OpenVINO can be built from source
   with either oneTBB or legacy TBB on all the systems listed here. System
   compatibility and performance are improved on Hybrid CPUs
   such as 12th Gen Intel Core and above.
