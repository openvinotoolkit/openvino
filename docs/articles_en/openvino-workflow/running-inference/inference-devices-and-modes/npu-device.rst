The Neural Processing Unit is a low-power hardware solution, introduced with the
Intel® Core™ Ultra generation of CPUs (formerly known as Meteor Lake). It enables
you to offload certain neural network computation tasks from other devices,
for more streamlined resource management.

NPU Plugin is now available through all relevant OpenVINO distribution channels.

| **Supported Platforms:**
|   Host: Intel® Core™ Ultra (former Meteor Lake)
|   NPU device: NPU 3720
|   OS: Ubuntu* 22.04 64-bit (with Linux kernel 6.6+), MS Windows* 11 64-bit (22H2, 23H2)

NPU Plugin needs an NPU Driver to be installed on the system for both compiling and executing a model.
Follow the instructions below to install the latest NPU drivers:

* `Windows driver <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/794734/intel-npu-driver-windows.html>`__
* `Linux driver <https://github.com/intel/linux-npu-driver/releases>`__


The plugin uses the graph extension API exposed by the driver to convert the OpenVINO specific representation
of the model into a proprietary format. The compiler included in the user mode driver (UMD) performs
platform specific optimizations in order to efficiently schedule the execution of network layers and
memory transactions on various NPU hardware submodules.

To use NPU for inference, pass the device name to the ``ov::Core::compile_model()`` method:

Model Caching
#############################

Model Caching helps reduce application startup delays by exporting and reusing the compiled
model automatically. The following two compilation-related metrics are crucial in this area:

| **First Ever Inference Latency (FEIL)**
|   Measures all steps required to compile and execute a model on the device for the
    first time. It includes model compilation time, the time required to load and
    initialize the model on the device and the first inference execution.
| **First Inference Latency (FIL)**
|   Measures the time required to load and initialize the pre-compiled model on the
    device and the first inference execution.


UMD Dynamic Model Caching
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

UMD model caching is a solution enabled by default in the current NPU driver.
It improves time to first inference (FIL) by storing the model in the cache
after the compilation (included in FEIL), based on a hash key. The process
may be summarized in three stages:

1. UMD generates the key from the input IR model and build arguments
2. UMD requests the DirectX Shader cache session to store the model
   with the computed key.
3. All subsequent requests to compile the same IR model with the same arguments
   use the pre-compiled model, reading it from the cache instead of recompiling.

UMD Dynamic Model Caching can be bypassed for given model by setting boolean property
ov::intel_npu::bypass_umd_caching (NPU_BYPASS_UMD_CACHE) to true at compilation. (default value is false)


OpenVINO Model Caching
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

OpenVINO Model Caching is a common mechanism for all OpenVINO device plugins and
can be enabled by setting the ``ov::cache_dir`` property. This way, the UMD model
caching is automatically bypassed by the NPU plugin, which means the model
will only be stored in the OpenVINO cache after compilation. When a cache hit
occurs for subsequent compilation requests, the plugin will import the model
instead of recompiling it.

For more details about OpenVINO model caching, see the
:doc:`Model Caching Overview <../optimize-inference/optimizing-latency/model-caching-overview>`.

| **Supported Inference Data Types**
| The NPU plugin supports the following data types as inference precision of internal primitives:
|    Floating-point data types: F32, F16
|    Quantized data types: U8 (quantized models may be INT8 or mixed FP16-INT8)
|    Computation precision for the HW is FP16.
|
| For more details on how to get a quantized model, refer to the
  :doc:`Model Optimization guide <../../model-optimization>` and
  :doc:`NNCF tool quantization guide <../../model-optimization-guide/quantizing-models-post-training/basic-quantization-flow>`.

Supported Features and properties
#######################################

The NPU device is currently supported by AUTO inference modes
(HETERO execution is partially supported, for certain models).

The NPU support in OpenVINO is still under active development and may
offer a limited set of supported OpenVINO features.

**Supported Properties:**

.. note::

   The optimum number of inference requests returned by the plugin
   based on the performance mode is **4 for THROUGHPUT** and **1 for LATENCY**.
   The default mode for the NPU device is LATENCY.

**ov::intel_npu::compilation_mode_params**

``ov::intel_npu::compilation_mode_params`` is an NPU-specific property that allows
control of model compilation for NPU.

.. note::

   The functionality is in experimental stage currently, can be a subject for
   deprecation and may be replaced with generic OV API in future OV releases.

Following configuration options are supported:

**optimization-level**

Defines an optimization effort hint to the compiler.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 200
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **Value**
     - **Description**
   * - 0
     - Reduced subset of optimization passes. May result in smaller compile time.
   * - 1
     - **Default.** Balanced performance/compile time.
   * - 2
     - Prioritize performance over compile time that may be an issue.

**performance-hint-override**

The LATENCY mode can be overridden by specifying ``ov::hint::performance_mode``
Has no effect for other ``ov::hint::PerformanceMode`` hints.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 200
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **Value**
     - **Description**
   * - efficiency
     - **Default.** Balanced performance and power consumption.
   * - latency
     - Prioritize performance over power efficiency.

Usage example:

.. code-block::

   map<str, str> config = {ov::intel_npu::compilation_mode_params.name(), ov::Any("optimization-level=1 performance-hint-override=latency")};

   compile_model(model, config);

**npu_turbo**

The turbo mode, where available, provides a hint to the system to maintain the
maximum NPU frequency and memory throughput within the platform TDP limits.
The turbo mode is not recommended for sustainable workloads due to higher power
consumption and potential impact on other compute resources.

.. code-block::

   core.set_property("NPU", ov::intel_npu::turbo(true));

or

.. code-block::

   core.compile_model(ov_model, "NPU", {ov::intel_npu::turbo(true)});

**ov::intel_npu::max_tiles and ov::intel_npu::tiles**

the ``max_tiles`` property is read-write to enable compiling models off-device. 
When on NPU, ``max_tiles`` will return the number of tiles the device has.
Setting the number of tiles to compile for (via ``intel_npu::tiles``), when on device,
must be preceded by reading ``intel_npu::max_tiles`` first, to make sure that 
``ov::intel_npu::tiles`` <= ``ov::intel_npu::max_tiles`` 
to avoid exceptions from the compiler.

.. note::

   ``ov::intel_npu::tiles`` overrides the default number of tiles selected by the compiler based on performance hints
   (``ov::hint::performance_mode``).
   Any tile number other than 1 may be a problem for cross platform compatibility,
   if not tested explicitly versus the max_tiles value.

Limitations
#############################

* Currently, only models with static shapes are supported on NPU.

**Import/Export:**

Offline compilation and blob import is supported only for development purposes.
Pre-compiled models (blobs) are not recommended to be used in production.
Blob compatibility across different OpenVINO / NPU Driver versions is not
guaranteed.
