   :description: Learn how to install OpenVINO™ Runtime on Windows, Linux, and
                 macOS operating systems, using a PyPi package.


.. note::

   Note that the PyPi distribution:

   * offers the Python API only
   * is dedicated to users of all major OSes: Windows, Linux, and macOS
     (all x86_64 / arm64 architectures)
   * Windows and Linux do not offer support for GNA and NPU inference
   * macOS offers support only for CPU inference

Installing OpenVINO Runtime
###########################

Step 1. Set Up Python Virtual Environment
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.
To create a virtual environment, use the following command:

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Windows
       :sync: windows

       .. code-block:: sh

          python -m venv openvino_env

    .. tab-item:: Linux and macOS
       :sync: linux-and-macos

       .. code-block:: sh

          python3 -m venv openvino_env


Step 2. Activate Virtual Environment
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Windows
       :sync: windows

       .. code-block:: sh

          openvino_env\Scripts\activate

    .. tab-item:: Linux and macOS
       :sync: linux-and-macos

       .. code-block:: sh

          source openvino_env/bin/activate


.. important::

   The above command must be re-run every time a new command terminal window is opened.


Step 3. Set Up and Update PIP to the Highest Version
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Use the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   python -m pip install --upgrade pip


Step 4. Install the Package
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Use the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   python -m pip install openvino


Step 5. Verify that the Package Is Installed
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Run the command below:

.. code-block:: sh

   python -c "from openvino import Core; print(Core().available_devices)"

If installation was successful, you will see the list of available devices.


Congratulations! You've just Installed OpenVINO! For some use cases you may still
need to install additional components. Check the
:doc:`list of additional configurations <openvino_docs_install_guides_configurations_header>`
to see if your case needs any of them.
