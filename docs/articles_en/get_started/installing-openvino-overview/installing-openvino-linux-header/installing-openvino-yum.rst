   :description: Learn how to install OpenVINO™ Runtime on Linux operating
                 system, using the YUM repository.

.. note::

   Note that the YUM distribution:

   * offers both C/C++ and Python APIs
   * does not offer support for GNA and NPU inference
   * is dedicated to Linux users only
   * additionally includes code samples

Install OpenVINO Runtime
########################

Step 1: Set Up the Repository
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


1. Create a YUM repository file (``openvino-2023.repo``) in the ``/tmp`` directory as a normal user:

   .. code-block:: sh

      tee > /tmp/openvino-2023.repo << EOF
      [OpenVINO]
      name=Intel(R) Distribution of OpenVINO 2023
      baseurl=https://yum.repos.intel.com/openvino/2023
      enabled=1
      gpgcheck=1
      repo_gpgcheck=1
      gpgkey=https://yum.repos.intel.com/intel-gpg-keys/GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-SW-PRODUCTS.PUB
      EOF

2. Move the new ``openvino-2023.repo`` file to the YUM configuration directory, i.e. ``/etc/yum.repos.d``:

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo mv /tmp/openvino-2023.repo /etc/yum.repos.d

3. Verify that the new repository is set up properly.

   .. code-block:: sh

      yum repolist | grep -i openvino

   You will see the available list of packages.


To list available OpenVINO packages, use the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   yum list 'openvino*'



Step 2: Install OpenVINO Runtime Using the YUM Package Manager
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Install OpenVINO Runtime
-------------------------

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: The Latest Version
      :sync: latest-version

      Run the following command:

      .. code-block:: sh

         sudo yum install openvino

   .. tab-item:: A Specific Version
      :sync: specific-version

      Run the following command:

      .. code-block:: sh

         sudo yum install openvino-<VERSION>.<UPDATE>.<PATCH>

      For example:

      .. code-block:: sh


         sudo yum install openvino-2023.3.0



Check for Installed Packages and Version
-----------------------------------------


Run the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   yum list installed 'openvino*'

.. note::

   You can additionally install Python API using one of the alternative methods (:doc:`conda <openvino_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_conda>` or :doc:`pip <openvino_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_pip>`).

Congratulations! You've just Installed OpenVINO! For some use cases you may still
need to install additional components. Check the
:doc:`list of additional configurations <openvino_docs_install_guides_configurations_header>`
to see if your case needs any of them.

With the YUM distribution, you can build OpenVINO sample files, as explained in the
:doc:`guide for OpenVINO sample applications <openvino_docs_OV_UG_Samples_Overview>`.
For C++ and C, just run the ``build_samples.sh`` script:

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: C++
      :sync: cpp

      .. code-block:: sh

         /usr/share/openvino/samples/cpp/build_samples.sh

   .. tab-item:: C
      :sync: c

      .. code-block:: sh

         /usr/share/openvino/samples/c/build_samples.sh



Uninstalling OpenVINO Runtime
##############################

To uninstall OpenVINO Runtime via YUM, run the following command based on your needs:

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: The Latest Version
      :sync: latest-version

      .. code-block:: sh

         sudo yum autoremove openvino


   .. tab-item:: A Specific Version
      :sync: specific-version

      .. code-block:: sh

         sudo yum autoremove openvino-<VERSION>.<UPDATE>.<PATCH>

      For example:

      .. code-block:: sh

         sudo yum autoremove openvino-2023.3.0
