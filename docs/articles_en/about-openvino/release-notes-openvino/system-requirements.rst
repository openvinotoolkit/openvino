System Requirements
===================


.. note::

   Certain hardware, including but not limited to GPU and NPU, requires manual installation of
   specific drivers and/or other software components to work correctly and/or to utilize
   hardware capabilities at their best. This might require updates to the operating
   system, including but not limited to Linux kernel, please refer to their documentation
   for details. These modifications should be handled by user and are not part of OpenVINO
   installation.

   .. tab-item:: Additional considerations

      * The use of GPU requires drivers that are not included in the Intel®
        Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit package.
      * Processor graphics are not included in all processors. See
        `Product Specifications <https://ark.intel.com/>`__
        for information about your processor.
      * While this release of OpenVINO supports Ubuntu 20.04, the driver stack
        for Intel discrete graphic cards does not fully support Ubuntu 20.04.
        We recommend using Ubuntu 22.04 and later when executing on discrete graphics.
      * OpenCL™ driver versions required may vary, depending on hardware and operating Systems
        used. Consult driver documentation to select the best version for your setup.

   .. tab-item:: Linux OS

      * Ubuntu 24.04 with Linux kernel 6.8+
      * Ubuntu 22.04 with Linux kernel 5.15+
      * Ubuntu 20.04 with Linux kernel 5.15+

      Build environment components:

      * Python 3.9-3.12
      * `Intel® HD Graphics Driver <https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers>`__
        required for inference on GPU
      * GNU Compiler Collection and CMake are needed for building from source:

        * `GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) <https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/>`__ 7.5 and above
        * `CMake <https://cmake.org/download/>`__ 3.13 or higher

      Higher versions of kernel might be required for 10th Gen Intel® Core™ Processors and above,
      Intel® Core™ Ultra Processors, 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors and above
      to support CPU, GPU, NPU or hybrid-cores CPU capabilities.

   .. tab-item:: Windows 10 and 11

      OpenVINO Runtime requires certain C++ libraries to operate. To execute ready-made apps,
      the libraries distributed by `Visual Studio redistributable package <https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe>`__
      are suggested. For development and compilation of OpenVINO-integrated apps, the build
      environment components are required instead.

      Build environment components:

      * `Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 or later <http://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/>`__
      * `CMake <https://cmake.org/download/>`__ 3.16 or higher
      * `Python <http://www.python.org/downloads/>`__ 3.9-3.12
      * `Intel® HD Graphics Driver <https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers>`__
        required for inference on GPU

   .. tab-item:: macOS

      * macOS 12.6 and above

      Build environment components:

      * `Xcode <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>`__ 10.3
      * `CMake <https://cmake.org/download/>`__ 3.13 or higher
      * `Python <http://www.python.org/downloads/>`__ 3.9-3.12

   .. tab-item:: DL framework versions:

      * TensorFlow 1.15.5 - 2.17
      * PyTorch 2.4
      * ONNX 1.16
      * PaddlePaddle 2.6
      * JAX 0.4.31 (via a path of jax2tf with native_serialization=False)

      This package can be installed on other versions of DL Frameworks
      but only the versions specified here are fully validated.

            .. important::

               When installing Python, make sure you click the option **Add Python 3.x to PATH** to `add Python <https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#installation-steps>`__ to your `PATH` environment variable.
