OpenVINO™ is always looking for opportunities to improve and your contributions
play a big role in this process. Here are four ways you can make OpenVINO better:

- `Provide feedback <#provide-feedback>`__
- `Contribute code changes <#contribute-code-changes>`__
- `Improve documentation <#improve-documentation>`__
- `Promote and support OpenVINO <#promote-and-support-openvino>`__


:fas:`comments` Provide feedback
################################

.. rubric:: Report bugs / issues
   :name: report-bugs-issues

If you notice unexpected behavior in OpenVINO or its components, you can
`create a new issue <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/issues>`__
in the GitHub issue tracker.

.. rubric:: Propose improvements
   :name: propose-improvements

If you want to share your ideas for improving OpenVINO:

- Open a new `GitHub Discussion <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/discussions>`__.
- Create a `Feature Request Issue <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/issues/new?assignees=octocat&labels=enhancement%2Cfeature&projects=&template=feature_request.yml&title=%5BFeature+Request%5D%3A+>`__
  if your idea is already well defined.

In both cases, provide a detailed description and list potential use cases,
benefits, and challenges. Keep in mind that even if your input is not immediately
prioritized, it may be used at a later or undertaken by the community.


:fas:`code-branch` Contribute code changes
##########################################

Always check if the change is still needed! Verify if
`the issue <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/issues>`__ or
`request <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/pulls>`__ is still open
and nobody has started working on it. If the ticket is already work in progress,
you can always ask if you can help.

**Address only the issues that affect the master or**
:doc:`LTS release branches <./release-notes-openvino/release-policy>`.

**Do not start work on contributions, if a proper issue/ request has not been created.**

.. tip::

   If you want to start with something simple, check out
   `first-time contributions <https://github.com/orgs/openvinotoolkit/projects/3>`__.


.. rubric:: Fix bugs
   :name: fix-bugs

Choose one of the issues reported in
`GitHub Issue Tracker <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/issues>`__ and
`create a Pull Request <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING_PR.md>`__
(PR) addressing it.

If you find a new bug and want to fix it, you should still
create a new issue before working on the PR. This way, it will be easier for other
developers to track changes.

.. rubric:: Develop new features
   :name: develop-new-features

If you find a `Feature Request <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/issues/new?assignees=octocat&labels=enhancement%2Cfeature&projects=&template=feature_request.yml&title=%5BFeature+Request%5D%3A+>`__
you want to work on, make sure it is clearly defined. If you have any doubts,
or the change is complex, `discuss it <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/discussions>`__
with OpenVINO developers first.

If you have an idea for a new feature and want
to develop it, you should still create a Feature Request  before working on the
PR. This way, it will be easier for other developers to track changes.

.. rubric:: Develop a new device plugin
   :name: develop-new-device-plugin

If you want to run inference on a device that is currently not supported, you
can see how to develop a new plugin for it in the
`Plugin Developer Guide <https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/documentation/openvino-extensibility/openvino-plugin-library.html>`__.


:fas:`file-alt` Improve documentation
#####################################

OpenVINO user documentation is built from several sources, mainly the files in
the `docs/articles_en <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/tree/master/docs/articles_en>`__
folder, using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`__ and the
`reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`__
markup language.

OpenVINO `developer documentation <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/tree/master/docs/dev>`__
is available only in markdown in the `docs/dev <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/tree/master/docs/dev>`__
folder.

To edit docs, consider using the Editor’s
`guide <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING_DOCS.md>`__
and contacting `documentation maintainers <https://github.com/orgs/openvinotoolkit/teams/openvino-docs-maintainers>`__,
who will help you with information architecture and formatting, as well as
review, adjust, and merge the PR.

.. rubric:: Review user documentation
   :name: review-user-documentation

In most cases, creating a PR is enough to correct a documentation mistake, improve
the language, and update or extend the information. For your convenience, the
top-right panel of most pages includes the “Edit on GitHub” button that will
take you to the source file of the given article.

.. rubric:: Write new content
   :name: write-new-content

For more extensive changes in docs, reach out to any of the
`documentation maintainers <https://github.com/orgs/openvinotoolkit/teams/openvino-docs-maintainers>`__
