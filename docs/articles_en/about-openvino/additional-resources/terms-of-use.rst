Intel Global Human Right Principles
###########################################################

Intel is committed to respecting human rights and avoiding causing or contributing to adverse
impacts on human rights. See
`Intel's Global Human Rights Principles <https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/central-libraries/us/en/documents/policy-human-rights.pdf>`__.
Intel's products and software are intended only to be used in applications that do not cause or
contribute to adverse impacts on human rights.




OpenVINO™ Logo
###########################################################

To build equity around the project, the OpenVINO logo was created for both Intel and community
usage. The logo may only be used to represent the OpenVINO toolkit and offerings built using
the OpenVINO toolkit.

The OpenVINO logo must be used in connection with truthful, non-misleading references to the
OpenVINO toolkit, and for no other purpose. Modification of the logo or use of any separate
element(s) of the logo alone is not allowed.




Model Card Statement
###########################################################

We recommend that, wherever you are sourcing the model from, you should check for a model card,
consult the model card for each model you access and use, and create one if you are developing
or updating a model. A model card is a short document that provides key information to assess
performance and validation and ensure appropriate use.


Performance claims
###########################################################

Performance varies by use, configuration and other factors. Learn more at
`www.intel.com/PerformanceIndex <https://www.intel.com/PerformanceIndex>`__.

Performance results are based on testing as of dates shown in configurations and may not
reflect all publicly available updates.

Your costs and results may vary.
