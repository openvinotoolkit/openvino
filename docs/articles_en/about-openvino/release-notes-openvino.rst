Deprecation And Support
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Using deprecated features and components is not advised. They are available to enable a smooth
transition to new solutions and will be discontinued in the future. To keep using discontinued
features, you will have to revert to the last LTS OpenVINO version supporting them.
For more details, refer to the `OpenVINO Legacy Features and Components <https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/documentation/legacy-features.html>__`
page.



Discontinued in 2025
-----------------------------

* Runtime components:

  * The OpenVINO property of Affinity API will is no longer available. It has been replaced with CPU
    binding configurations (``ov::hint::enable_cpu_pinning``).

* Tools:

  * The OpenVINO™ Development Tools package (pip install openvino-dev) is no longer available
    for OpenVINO releases in 2025.
  * Model Optimizer is no longer available. Consider using the
    :doc:`new conversion methods <../openvino-workflow/model-preparation/convert-model-to-ir>`
    instead. For more details, see the
    `model conversion transition guide <https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/documentation/legacy-features/transition-legacy-conversion-api.html>`__.
  * Intel® Streaming SIMD Extensions (Intel® SSE) are currently not enabled in the binary
    package by default. They are still supported in the source code form.


Deprecated and to be removed in the future
--------------------------------------------

* Ubuntu 20.04 support will be deprecated in future OpenVINO releases due to the end of
  standard support.
* The openvino-nightly PyPI module will soon be discontinued. End-users should proceed with the
  Simple PyPI nightly repo instead. More information in
  `Release Policy <https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/about-openvino/release-notes-openvino/release-policy.html#nightly-releases>`__.
* “auto shape” and “auto batch size” (reshaping a model in runtime) will be removed in the
  future. OpenVINO's dynamic shape models are recommended instead.
* MacOS x86 is no longer recommended for use due to the discontinuation of validation.
  Full support will be removed later in 2025.
* The `openvino` namespace of the OpenVINO Python API has been redesigned, removing the nested
  `openvino.runtime` module. The old namespace is now considered deprecated and will be
  discontinued in 2026.0.
