OpenVINO™ Runtime
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Common
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Delayed weight compression is now available - compressed weights are not stored in memory
  but saved to a file immediately after compression to control memory consumption.
* Register extensions per frontend (update for extension API)
* mmaped tensors havve been added, to read ov::Tensor from file on disk using mmap and
  help reduce memory consumption in some scenarios, for example, when using LoRa adapters
  in GenAI.


CPU Device Plugin
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Dynamic quantization of Fully Connected layers with asymmetric weights is now enabled on
  Intel AVX2 platforms, improving out-of-the-box performance for 8bit/4bit asymmetric
  weight-compressed LLMs.
* Performance of weight compressed LLMs for long prompts has been optimized on Intel client
  and Xeon platforms, especially on 1st token latency.
* Optimization of QKV (Query, Key, and Value) projection and MLP (Multilayer Perceptrons)
  fusion for LLMs has been extended to support BF16 on Windows OS for performance
  improvements on AMX platforms.
* GEMM kernel has been removed from the OpenVINO CPU library, reducing its size.
* FP8 (alias for f8e4m3 and f8e5m2) model support has been enhanced with optimized FakeConvert
  operator. Compilation time for FP8 LLMs has also been improved.

GPU Device Plugin
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Second token latency of large language models has been improved on all GPU platforms
  with optimization of translation lookaside buffer (TLB) scenario and
  Group Query Attention (GQA).
* First token latency of large language models has been improved on
  Intel Core Ultra Processors Series 2 with Paged Attention optimization.
* Int8 compressed KV-cache is enabled for LLMs by default on all GPU platforms.

  with XMX (Xe Matrix eXtensions).

NPU Device Plugin
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Support for LLM weightless caching and encryption of LLM blobs.
* When a model is imported from cache, you can now use ``ov::internal::cached_model_buffer``
  to reduce memory footprint.
* NF4 (4-bit NormalFloat) inputs/outputs are now supported. E2E support depends on the
  driver version.
* The following issues have been fixed:

  * for stateful models: update level zero command list when tensor is relocated.
  * for zeContextDestroy error that occurred when applications were using static ov::Cores.

OpenVINO Python API
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Ability to create a Tensor directly from a Pillow image, eliminating the need for
  casting it to a NumPy array first.
* Optimization of memory consumption for export_model, read_model, and compile_model methods.

OpenVINO Node.js API
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Node.js bindings for OpenVINO GenAI are now available in the genai-node npm package
  and bring the simplicity of OpenVINO GenAI API to Node.js applications.

PyTorch Framework Support
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* PyTorch version 2.6 is now supported.
* Common translators have been implemented to unify decompositions for operations of multiple
  frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX, JAX) and to support complex tensors.

TensorFlow Lite Framework Support
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Enabled support for models which use quantized tensors between layers in runtime.

OpenVINO Model Server
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Major new features:

  * VLM support with continuous batching - the endpoint `chat/completion` has been extended
    to support vision models. Now it is possible to send images in the context of chat.
    Vision models can be deployed like the LLM models.
  * NPU acceleration for text generation - now it is possible to deploy LLM and VLM models
    on NPU accelerator. Text generation will be exposed over completions and chat/completions
    endpoints. From the client perspective it works the same way as in GPU and CPU deployment,
    however it doesn't use the continuous batching algorithm, and target is AI PC use cases
    with low concurrency.

* Other improvements

  * Model management improvements - mediapipe graphs and generative endpoints can be now
    started just using command line parameters without the configuration file. Configuration
    file Json structure for models and graphs has been unified under the
    `models_config_list` section.
  * Updated scalability demonstration using multiple instances, see
    `the demo <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server/tree/releases/2025/1/demos/continuous_batching/scaling>`__.
  * Increased allowed number of stop words in a request from 4 to 16.
  * Integration with the Visual Studio Code extension of Continue has been enabled making
    it possible to use the assistance of local AI service while writing code.
  * Performance improvements - enhancements in OpenVINO Runtime and also text sampling
    generation algorithm which should increase the throughput in high concurrency load
    scenarios.

* Breaking changes

  * gRPC server is now optional. There is no default gRPC port set. The ``--port`` parameter
    is mandatory to start the gRPC server. It is possible to start REST API server only with
    the ``--rest_port`` parameter. At least one port number needs to be defined to start
    OVMS server from CLI (--port or --rest_port). Starting OVMS server via C API calls does
    not require any port to be defined.

* The following issues have been fixed:

  * Handling of the LLM context length - OVMS will now stop generating the text when model
    context is exceeded. An error will be raised when the prompt is longer from the context
    or when the max_tokens plus the input tokens exceeds the model context.
    In addition, it is possible to constrain the max number of generated tokens for all
    users of the model.
  * Security and stability improvements.
  * Cancellation of LLM generation without streaming.

* Known limitations

  * `Chat/completions` accepts images encoded to base64 format but not as URL links.

Neural Network Compression Framework
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Preview support for the Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with LoRA adapters for more
  accurate 4-bit weight compression of LLMs in PyTorch. The ``nncf.compress_weight`` API has
  been extended by a new ``compression_format`` option: ``CompressionFormat.FQ_LORA``, for this
  QAT method. To see how it works, see
  `the sample <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/tree/develop/examples/llm_compression/torch/qat_with_lora>`__.
* Added Activation-aware Weight Quantization and Scale Estimation data-aware 4-bit compression
  methods for PyTorch backend. Now the compression of LLMs can directly be applied to PyTorch
  models to speed up the process.
* Reduced Generative Pre-trained Transformers Quantization (GPTQ) compression time and peak
  memory usage.
* Reduced compression time and peak memory usage of data-free mixed precision weight
  compression.
* New tracing for PyTorch models based on TorchFunctionMode for ``nncf.quantize`` and
  ``nncf.compress_weights``, which does not require torch namespace fixes.
  Disabled by default, it can be enabled by the environment variable ``"NNCF_EXPERIMENTAL_TORCH_TRACING=1”``.
* Multiple improvements in TorchFX backend to comply with the Torch AO guidelines:

  * The constant folding pass is removed from the OpenVINO Quantizer and the  ``quantize_pt2e``
    function.
  * Support for dynamic shape TorchFX models.

* Initial steps to adopt custom quantizers in quantize_pt2e within NNCF:

  * The hardware configuration is generalized with the narrow_range parameter.
  * The quantizer parameter calculation code is refactored to explicitly depend on narrow_range.

* Preview support of the OpenVINO backend in `ExecuTorch <https://github.com/pytorch/executorch>`__
  has been introduced, model quantization is implemented via the function:
  `nncf.experimental.torch.fx.quantize_pt2e <https://openvinotoolkit.github.io/nncf/autoapi/nncf/experimental/torch/fx/index.html#nncf.experimental.torch.fx.quantize_pt2e>`__.
* PyTorch version 2.6 is now supported.

* Build OpenVINO Tokenizers with installed ICU (International Components for Unicode)
  plugin for reduced binary size.
* max_length and padding rule parameters can be dynamically adjusted with Tokenizer class
  from OpenVINO GenAI.
* Remove fast_tokenizer dependency, no core_tokenizers binary in the OpenVINO Tokenizers
  distribution anymore.

OpenVINO.GenAI
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* The following has been added:

  * Preview support for the Token Eviction mechanism for more efficient KVCache memory
    management of LLMs during text generation. Disabled by default.
    `See the sample <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai/blob/master/site/docs/concepts/optimization-techniques/kvcache-eviction-algorithm.md>`__.
  * LLMPipeline C bindings and JavaScript bindings.
  * StreamerBase::write(int64_t token) and
    StreamerBase::write(const std::vector<int64_t>& tokens).
  * Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct and Phi-3.5-vision-instruct support for VLMPipeline.
  * Added Image2image and inpainting pipelines that support FLUX and Stable-Diffusion-3.

* LLMPipeline now uses Paged Attention backend by default.
* Streaming is now performed in a separate thread while the next token is being inferred by LLM.
* Chat template is applied even with disabled chat mode. Use the ``apply_chat_template`` flag
  to disable chat template in GenerationConfig.
* Time consuming methods now release Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).

Other Changes and Known Issues

   | ID: 160167
   | Description:
   |   TensorFlow Object Detection models converted to the IR through the OVC tool gives poor
       performance on CPU, GPU, and NPU devices. As a workaround, please use the MO tool from
       2024.6 or earlier to generate IRs.

   | **Component: Tokenizers**
   | ID: 159392
   | Description:
   |   ONNX model fails to convert when openvino-tokenizers is installed. As a workaround please
       uninstall openvino-tokenizers to convert ONNX model to the IR.

   | **Component: CPU Plugin**
   | ID: 161336
   | Description:
   |   Compilation of an openvino model performing weight quantization fails with Segmentation
       Fault on Intel® Core™ Ultra 200V processors. The following workaround can be applied to
       make it work with existing OV versions (including 25.0 RCs) before application run:
       export DNNL_MAX_CPU_ISA=AVX2_VNNI.

   | **Component: GPU Plugin**
   | ID: 160802
   | Description:
   |   mllama model crashes on Intel® Core™ Ultra 200V processors. Please use OpenVINO 2024.6 or
       earlier to run the model.

   | **Component: GPU Plugin**
   | ID: 160948
   | Description:
   |   Several models have accuracy degradation on Intel® Core™ Ultra 200V processors,
       Intel® Arc™ A-Series Graphics, and Intel® Arc™ B-Series Graphics. Please use OpenVINO 2024.6
       to run the models. Model list: fastseg-small, hbonet-0.5,
       modnet_photographic_portrait_matting, modnet_webcam_portrait_matting,
       mobilenet-v3-small-1.0-224, nasnet-a-mobile-224, yolo_v4, yolo_v5m, yolo_v5s, yolo_v8n,
       yolox-tiny, yolact-resnet50-fpn-pytorch.

































Deprecation And Support
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Using deprecated features and components is not advised. They are available to enable a smooth
transition to new solutions and will be discontinued in the future. To keep using discontinued
features, you will have to revert to the last LTS OpenVINO version supporting them.
For more details, refer to:
`OpenVINO Legacy Features and Components <https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/documentation/legacy-features.html>`__.



Discontinued in 2025
-----------------------------

* Runtime components:

  * The OpenVINO property of Affinity API is no longer available. It has been replaced with CPU
    binding configurations (``ov::hint::enable_cpu_pinning``).
  * The openvino-nightly PyPI module has been discontinued. End-users should proceed with the
    Simple PyPI nightly repo instead. More information in
    `Release Policy <https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/about-openvino/release-notes-openvino/release-policy.html#nightly-releases>`__.

* Tools:

  * The OpenVINO™ Development Tools package (pip install openvino-dev) is no longer available
    for OpenVINO releases in 2025.
  * Model Optimizer is no longer available. Consider using the
    :doc:`new conversion methods <../openvino-workflow/model-preparation/convert-model-to-ir>`
    instead. For more details, see the
    `model conversion transition guide <https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/documentation/legacy-features/transition-legacy-conversion-api.html>`__.
  * Intel® Streaming SIMD Extensions (Intel® SSE) are currently not enabled in the binary
    package by default. They are still supported in the source code form.
  * Legacy prefixes: ``l_``, ``w_``, and ``m_`` have been removed from OpenVINO archive names.

* OpenVINO GenAI:

  * StreamerBase::put(int64_t token)
  * The ``Bool`` value for Callback streamer is no longer accepted. It must now return one of
    three values of StreamingStatus enum.
  * ChunkStreamerBase is deprecated. Use StreamerBase instead.

* NNCF ``create_compressed_model()`` method is now deprecated. ``nncf.quantize()`` method is
  recommended for Quantization-Aware Training of PyTorch and TensorFlow models.

* OpenVINO Model Server (OVMS) benchmark client in C++ using TensorFlow Serving API.







Deprecated and to be removed in the future
--------------------------------------------

* ``openvino.Type.undefined`` is now deprecated and will be removed with version 2026.0.
  ``openvino.Type.dynamic`` should be used instead.
* APT & YUM Repositories Restructure:
  Starting with release 2025.1, users can switch to the new repository structure for APT and YUM,
  which no longer uses year-based subdirectories (like “2025”). The old (legacy) structure will
  still be available until 2026, when the change will be finalized.
  Detailed instructions are available on the relevant documentation pages:

  * `Installation guide - yum <https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/get-started/install-openvino/install-openvino-yum.html>`__
  * `Installation guide - apt <https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/get-started/install-openvino/install-openvino-apt.html>`__

* OpenCV binaries will be removed from Docker images in 2026.
* Ubuntu 20.04 support will be deprecated in future OpenVINO releases due to the end of
  standard support.
* “auto shape” and “auto batch size” (reshaping a model in runtime) will be removed in the
  future. OpenVINO's dynamic shape models are recommended instead.
* MacOS x86 is no longer recommended for use due to the discontinuation of validation.
  Full support will be removed later in 2025.
* The `openvino` namespace of the OpenVINO Python API has been redesigned, removing the nested
  `openvino.runtime` module. The old namespace is now considered deprecated and will be
  discontinued in 2026.0.
