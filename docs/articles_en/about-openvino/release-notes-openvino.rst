OpenVINO™ Runtime
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Common
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Public API has been added to set and reset the log message handling callback.
  It allows injecting an external log handler to read OpenVINO messages in the user's infrastructure,
  rather than from log files left by OpenVINO.
* Build-time optimizations have been introduced to improve developer experience in project compilation.
* Ability to import a precompiled model from an `ov::Tensor` has been added. Using `ov::Tensor`, 
  which also supports memory-mapped files, to store precompiled models benefits both the OpenVINO 
  caching mechanism and applications using `core.import_model()`. 
* Several fixes for conversion between different precisions, such as u2 and f32->f4e2,1, 
  have been implemented to improve compatibility with quantized models. 
* Support for negative indices in GatherElements and GatherND operators has been added to 
  ensure compliance with ONNX standards. 
* vLLM-OpenVINO integration now supports vLLM API v1. 

CPU Device Plugin
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Sage Attention is now supported. This feature is turned on with the ``ENABLE_SAGE_ATTN`` property, 
  providing a performance boost for 1st token generation in LLMs with long prompts, 
  while maintaining accuracy. 
* FP16 model performance on 6th generation Intel® Xeon® processors has been enhanced by improving 
  utilization of the underlying AMX FP16 capabilities and graph-level optimizations.

GPU Device Plugin
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* LLM accuracy has been improved with by-channel key cache compression. Default KV-cache compression 
  has also been switched from by-token to by-channel compression.
* Gemma3-4b and Qwen-VL VLM performance has been improved on XMX-supporting platforms. 
* Basic functionalities for dynamic shape custom operations in GPU extension have been enabled. 
* LoRA performance has been improved for systolic platforms. 

NPU Device Plugin
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Models compressed as NF4-FP16 are now enabled on NPU. This is the recommended precision 
  for the following models: deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-7b, deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-14b, 
  and qwen2-7b-instruct, providing a reasonable balance between accuracy and performance. 
  This quantization is not supported on Intel® Core™ Ultra Series 1, where only symmetrically 
  quantized channel-wise or group-wise INT4-FP16 models are supported.
* Peak memory consumption of LLMs on NPU has been significantly reduced when using ahead-of-time compilation.
* Optimizations for LLM vocabularies (LM Heads) compressed in INT8 asymmetric have been introduced, 
  available with NPU driver 32.0.100.4181 or later. 
* Accuracy of LLMs with RoPE on longer contexts has been improved. 
* The NPU plug-in now supports dynamic batch sizes by reshaping the model to a batch size of 1 and concurrently managing multiple inference requests, enhancing performance and optimizing memory utilization. This requires driver 32.0.202.298 or later. 
* The remote tensor interface has been extended to support tensor creation from files; recent NPU drivers now support memory-mapped inputs/outputs.

OpenVINO Python API
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* TensorVector binding has been enabled to avoid extra copies and speed up PostponedConstant usage. 
* Support for building experimental free-threaded 3.13t Python API has been added; prebuilt 
  wheels are not distributed yet.
* Free-threaded Python performance has been improved. 
* `set_rt_info()` method has been added to Node, Output, and Input to align with `Model.set_rt_info()`.

OpenVINO Node.js API
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* AsyncInferQueue class has been added to support easier implementation of asynchronous inference. 
  The change comes with a benchmark tool to evaluate performance.
* `Model.reshape` method has been exposed, including type conversion ability and type validation helpers, useful for reshaping LLMs.
* Support for ov-node types in TypeScript part of bindings has been extended, enabling  direct integration with the JavaScript API. 
* Wrapping of `compileModel()` method has been fixed to allow checking type of returned objects.  


PyTorch Framework Support 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Tensor concatenation inside loops is now supported, enabling the Paraformer model family.

OpenVINO™ Model Server
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Major new features:
  
  * Tool-guided generation has been implemented with the `enable_tool_guided_generation` parameter and
    `–tool_parser` option to enable model-specific XGrammar configuration for following expected response syntax. It uses dynamic rules based on the generated sequence, increasing model accuracy and minimizing invalid response formats for tools.
  * Tool parser has been added for Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, extending the list of supported 
    models with tool handling.
  * Stream response has been implemented for Qwen3, Hermes3 and Llama3 models, enabling more interactive use with tools.
  * BREAKING CHANGE: Separation of tool parser and reasoning parser has been implemented. Instead of the `response_parser` parameter, use separate parameters: `tool_parser` and `reasoning_parser`, allowing more flexible implementation and configuration on the server. Parsers can now be shared independently between models. Currently, Qwen3 is the only reasoning parser implemented. 
  * Reading of the chat template has been changed from `template.jinja` to `chat_template.jinja` if the chat template is not included in `tokenizer_config.json`.
  * Structured output is now supported with the addition of JSON schema-guided generation using the OpenAI `response_format` field. This parameter enables generation of JSON responses for automation purposes and improvements in response accuracy. See `Structured response in LLM models <https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/model-server/ovms_structured_output.html>`__ article for more details. A script testing the accuracy gain is also included.
  * Enforcement of tool call generation has been implemented using the `tool_call=required` in chat/completions field. This feature forces the model to generate at least one tool response, increasing response reliability while not guaranteeing response validity.
  * `MCP server demo <https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/model-server/ovms_demos_continuous_batching_agent.html>`__ has been updated to include available features.

* New models and use cases supported:
   
  * Qwen3-embedding and cross-encoders embedding models,
  * Qwen3-reranker,
  * Gemma3 VLM models.
  
* Deployment improvements:
  
  * Progress bar display has been implemented for model downloads from Hugging Face. For models from the OpenVINO organization, download status is now shown in the logs.
  * `Documentation <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server/blob/main/docs/pull_optimum_cli.md>`__  on how to build a docker image with optimum-cli is now available, enabling the image to pull any model from Hugging Face and convert it to IR online in one step.
  * Models endpoint for OpenAI has been implemented, returning a list of available models in the expected OpenAI JSON schema for easier integration with existing applications.
  * The package size has been reduced by removing git and gitlfs dependencies, reducing the image by ~15MB. Model files are now pulled from Hugging Face using libgit2 and curl libraries.
  * UTF-8 chat template is now supported out of the box, no additional installation steps on Windows required.
  * Preview functionality for GGUF models has been added for LLM architectures including Qwen2, Qwen2.5, and Llama3. Models can now be deployed directly from HuggingFace Hub by passing `model_id` and file name. Note that accuracy and performance may be lower than with IR format models.
* Bug fixes:
  
  * Truncation of prompts exceeding model length in embeddings has been implemented. 

Neural Network Compression Framework
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* 4-bit data-aware Scale Estimation and AWQ compression methods have been introduced for ONNX 
  models, providing more accurate compression results.
* NF4 data type is now supported as an FP8 look-up table for faster inference. 
* New parameter has been added to support a fallback group size in 4-bit weight compression 
  methods. This helps when the specified group size can not be applied, for example,
  in models with an unusual number of channels in matrix multiplication (matmuls). When enabled with 
  `nncf.AdvancedCompressionParameters(group_size_fallback_mode=ADJUST)`, NNCF automatically 
  adjusts the group size. By default, `nncf.AdvancedCompressionParameters(group_size_fallback_mode=IGNORE)` 
  is used, meaning that NNCF will not compress nodes when the specified group size can not be applied. 
* Initialization for 4-bit QAT with absorbable LoRA has been enhanced using advanced compression methods 
  (AWQ + Scale Estimation). This replaces the previous basic data-free compression 
  approach, enabling QAT to start with a more accurate model baseline and achieve better final accuracy.
* External quantizers in the `quantize_pt2e` API have been enabled, including `XNNPACKQuantizer  <https://docs.pytorch.org/executorch/stable/backends-xnnpack.html>`__
  and `CoreMLQuantizer <https://docs.pytorch.org/executorch/stable/backends-coreml.html>`__.
* PyTorch 2.8 is now supported. 

OpenVINO Tokenizers
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* OpenVINO GenAI integration: 

  * Padding side can now be set dynamically during runtime.
  * Tokenizer loading now supports a second input for relevant GenAI pipelines, for example TextRerankPipeline.

* Two inputs are now supported to accommodate a wider range of tokenizer types. 

OpenVINO GenAI
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* New OpenVINO GenAI docs homepage: https://openvinotoolkit.github.io/openvino.genai/
* Transitioned from Jinja2Cpp to Minja, improving chat_template coverage support.
* Cache eviction algorithms added:

  * KVCrush algorithm
  * Sparse attention prefill

* Support for Structured Output for flexible and efficient structured generation with XGrammar:

  * C++ and Python samples
  * Constraint sampling with Regex, JSONSchema, EBNF Grammar and Structural tags
  * Compound grammar to combine multiple grammar types (Regex, JSONSchema, EBNF) using Union (|) and Concat (+) operations for more flexible and complex output constraints.

* GGUF 

  * Qwen3 architecture is now supported 
  * `enable_save_ov_model` property to serialize generated ov::Model as IR for faster 
    LLMPipeline construction next time 

* LoRA  

  * Dynamic LoRA for NPU has been enabled.
  * Model weights can now be overridden from .safetensors 

* Tokenizer

  * `padding_side property` has been added to specify padding direction (left or right) 
  * `add_second_input` property to transform Tokenizer from one input to two inputs, 
    used for TextRerankPipeline

* JavaScript bindings:

  * New pipeline: TextEmbeddingPipeline 
  * PerfMetrics for the LLMPipeline 
  * Implemented getTokenizer into LLMPipeline

* Other changes:

  * C API for WhisperPipeline has been added 
  * gemma3-4b-it model is now supported in VLM Pipeline
  * Performance metrics for speculative decoding have been extended
  * Qwen2-VL and Qwen2.5-VL have been optimized for GPU 
  * Exporting stateful Whisper models is now supported on NPU out of the box, using `--disable-stateful` is no longer required.
  
* Dynamic prompts are now enabled by default on NPU: 
  	  
  * Longer contexts are available as preview feature on 32GB Intel® Core™ Ultra Series 2 (with prompt size up to 8..12K tokens). 
  * The default chunk size is 1024 and can be controlled via property `NPUW_LLM_PREFILL_CHUNK_SIZE`. For example, set it to 256 to see the effect on shorter prompts. 
  * `PREFILL_HINT` can be set to STATIC to bring back the old behavior.

.. dropdown:: 2025.2 - 18 June 2025

	**OpenVINO™ Runtime**

	*Common*

	* Better developer experience with shorter build times, due to optimizations and source code refactoring. Code readability has been improved, helping developers understand the components included between different C++ files.
	* Memory consumption has been optimized by expanding the usage of mmap for the GenAI component and introducing the delayed constant weights mechanism.
	* Support for ISTFT operator for GPU has been expanded, improving support of text-to-speech,speech-to-text, and speech-to-speech models, like AudioShake and Kokoro.
	* Models like Behavior Sequence Transformer are now supported, thanks to SparseFillEmptyRows and SegmentMax operators. 
	* google/fnet-base, tf/InstaNet, and more models are now enabled, thanks to DFT operators (discrete Fourier transform) supporting dynamism.
	* "COMPILED_BLOB" hint property is now available to speed up model compilation. The "COMPILED_BLOB" can be a regular or weightless model. For weightless models, the "WEIGHT_PATH" hint provides location of the model weights. 
	* Reading tensor data from file as copy or using mmap feature is now available. 

	*AUTO Inference Mode*

	* Memory footprint in model caching has been reduced by loading the model only for the selected plugin, avoiding duplicate model objects.

	*CPU Device Plugin*
	
	* Per-channel INT8 KV cache compression is now enabled by default, helping LLMs maintain accuracy while reducing memory consumption.
	* Per-channel INT4 KV cache compression is supported and can be enabled using the properties `KEY_CACHE_PRECISION` and `KEY_CACHE_QUANT_MODE`. Some models may be sensitive to INT4 KV cache compression.
	* Performance of encoder-based LLMs has been improved through additional graph-level optimizations, including QKV (Query, Key, and Value) projection and Multi-Head Attention (MHA).
	* SnapKV support has been implemented in the CPU plugin to reduce KV cache size while maintaining comparable performance. It calculates attention scores in PagedAttention for both prefill and decode stages. This feature is enabled by default in OpenVINO GenAI when KV cache eviction is used.

	*GPU Device Plugin*
	
	* Performance of generative models (e.g. large language models, visual language models, image generation models) has been improved on XMX-based platforms (Intel® Core™ Ultra Processor Series 2 built-in GPUs and Intel® Arc™ B Series Graphics) with dynamic quantization and optimization in GEMM and Convolution.
	* 2nd token latency of INT4 generative models has been improved on Intel® Core™ Processors, Series 1.
	* LoRa support has been optimized for Intel® Core™ Processor GPUs and its memory footprint improved, by optimizing the OPS nodes dependency.

	* Improvements to Paged Attention performance and functionality have been made, with support of different head sizes for Key and Value in KV-Cache inputs.
	 
	*NPU Device Plugin*

	* The NPU Plugin can now retrieve options from the compiler and mark only the corresponding OpenVINO properties as supported.
	* The model import path now supports passing precompiled models directly to the plugin using the `ov::compiled_blob` property (Tensor), removing the need for stream access.
	* The `ov::intel_npu::turbo` property is now forwarded both to the compiler and the driver when supported. Using NPU_TURBO may result in longer compile time, increased memory footprint, changes in workload latency, and compatibility issues with older NPU drivers.
	* The same Level Zero context is now used across OpenVINO Cores, enabling remote tensors created through one Core object to be used with inference requests created with another Core object.
	* BlobContainer has been replaced with regular OpenVINO tensors, simplifying the underlying container for a compiled blob.
	* Weightless caching and compilation for LLMs are now available when used with OpenVINO GenAI.
	* LLM accuracy issues with BF16 models have been resolved.
	* The NPU driver is now included in OpenVINO Docker images for Ubuntu, enabling out-of-the-box NPU support without manual driver installation. For instructions, refer to the `OpenVINO Docker documentation <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/docker_ci/blob/master/docs/npu_accelerator.md>`__.
	* NPU support for FP16-NF4 precision on Intel® Core™ 200V Series processors for models with up to 8B parameters is enabled through symmetrical and channel-wise quantization, improving accuracy while maintaining performance efficiency. FP16-NF4 is not supported on CPUs and GPUs.

	*OpenVINO Python API*

	* Wheel package and source code now include type hinting support (.pyi files), to help Python developers work in IDE. By default, pyi files will be generated automatically but can be triggered manually by developers themselves.

	* Other improvements

	  * VLM models with chat/completion endpoint can now support passing the images as URL or as path to a local file system.
	  * Option to use C++ only server version with support for LLM models. This smaller deployment package can be used both for completion and chat/completions.

	* The following issues have been fixed:

	  * Correct error status now reported in streaming mode.

	* Known limitations

	  * VLM models QuenVL2, QwenVL2.5 and Phi3_VL have low accuracy when deployed in a text generation pipeline with continuous batching. It is recommended to deploy these models in a stateful pipeline which processes the requests serially.

	**Neural Network Compression Framework**

	* Data-free AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization) method for 4-bit weight compression, nncf.compress_weights(), is now available for OpenVINO models. Now it is possible to compress weights to 4-bit with AWQ even without the dataset.
	* 8-bit and 4-bit data-free weight compression, nncf.compress_weights(), is now available  for models in ONNX format. `See example <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/tree/develop/examples/llm_compression/onnx/tiny_llama>`__.
	* 4-bit data-aware AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization) and Scale Estimation methods are now available for models in the TorchFX format.
	* TorchFunctionMode-based model tracing is now enabled by default for PyTorch models in nncf.quantize() and nncf.compress_weights().
	* Neural Low-Rank Adapter Search (NLS) Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) for more accurate 4-bit compression of LLMs on downstream tasks is now available. `See example <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/tree/develop/examples/llm_compression/torch/downstream_qat_with_nls>`__.
	* Weight compression time for NF4 data type has been reduced.

	 * Text2SpeechPipeline,
	 * TextEmbeddingPipeline covering RAG scenario.

	* Visual language modeling (VLMPipeline):

	 * VLM prompt can now refer to specific images. For example, ``<ov_genai_image_0>What’s in the image?`` will prepend the corresponding image to the prompt 
		while ignoring other images. See VLMPipeline’s docstrings for more details.
	 * VLM uses continuous batching by default, improving performance.
	 * VLMPipeline can now be constructed from in-memory `ov::Model`.
	 * Qwen2.5-VL support has been added.

	* JavaScript: 

	 * JavaScript samples have been added: beam_search_causal_lm and multinomial_causal_lm.
	 * An interruption option for LLMPipeline streaming has been introduced.
	 
	* The following has been added:

	 * cache encryption samples demonstrating how to encode OpenVINO’s cached compiled model,

	**OpenVINO™ Runtime**

	*Common*

	* Delayed weight compression is now available - compressed weights are not stored in memory
	  but saved to a file immediately after compression to control memory consumption.
	* Register extensions per frontend (update for extension API)
	* mmaped tensors havve been added, to read ov::Tensor from file on disk using mmap and
	  help reduce memory consumption in some scenarios, for example, when using LoRa adapters
	  in GenAI.

	*CPU Device Plugin*

	* Dynamic quantization of Fully Connected layers with asymmetric weights is now enabled on
	  Intel AVX2 platforms, improving out-of-the-box performance for 8bit/4bit asymmetric
	  weight-compressed LLMs.
	* Performance of weight compressed LLMs for long prompts has been optimized on Intel client
	  and Xeon platforms, especially on 1st token latency.
	* Optimization of QKV (Query, Key, and Value) projection and MLP (Multilayer Perceptrons)
	  fusion for LLMs has been extended to support BF16 on Windows OS for performance
	  improvements on AMX platforms.
	* GEMM kernel has been removed from the OpenVINO CPU library, reducing its size.
	* FP8 (alias for f8e4m3 and f8e5m2) model support has been enhanced with optimized FakeConvert
	  operator. Compilation time for FP8 LLMs has also been improved.

	*GPU Device Plugin*

	* Second token latency of large language models has been improved on all GPU platforms
	  with optimization of translation lookaside buffer (TLB) scenario and
	  Group Query Attention (GQA).
	* First token latency of large language models has been improved on
	  Intel Core Ultra Processors Series 2 with Paged Attention optimization.
	* Int8 compressed KV-cache is enabled for LLMs by default on all GPU platforms.
	* Performance of VLM (visual language models) has been improved on GPU platforms
	  with XMX (Xe Matrix eXtensions).

	*NPU Device Plugin*

	* Support for LLM weightless caching and encryption of LLM blobs.
	* When a model is imported from cache, you can now use ``ov::internal::cached_model_buffer``
	  to reduce memory footprint.
	* NF4 (4-bit NormalFloat) inputs/outputs are now supported. E2E support depends on the
	  driver version.
	* The following issues have been fixed:

	  * for stateful models: update level zero command list when tensor is relocated.
	  * for zeContextDestroy error that occurred when applications were using static ov::Cores.

	*OpenVINO Python API*

	* Ability to create a Tensor directly from a Pillow image, eliminating the need for
	  casting it to a NumPy array first.
	* Optimization of memory consumption for export_model, read_model, and compile_model methods.

	*OpenVINO Node.js API*

	* Node.js bindings for OpenVINO GenAI are now available in the genai-node npm package
	  and bring the simplicity of OpenVINO GenAI API to Node.js applications.

	*PyTorch Framework Support*

	* PyTorch version 2.6 is now supported.
	* Common translators have been implemented to unify decompositions for operations of multiple
	  frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX, JAX) and to support complex tensors.
	* FP8 model conversion is now supported.
	* Conversion of TTS models containing STFT/ISTFT operators has been enabled.

	*JAX Framework Support*

	* JAX 0.5.2 and Flax 0.10.4 have been added to validation.

	*Keras 3 Multi-backend Framework Support*

	* Keras 3.9.0 is now supported.
	* Provided more granular test exclusion mechanism for convenient enabling per operation.

	*TensorFlow Lite Framework Support*

	* Enabled support for models which use quantized tensors between layers in runtime.

	**OpenVINO Model Server**

	* Major new features:

	  * VLM support with continuous batching - the endpoint `chat/completion` has been extended
		 to support vision models. Now it is possible to send images in the context of chat.
		 Vision models can be deployed like the LLM models.
	  * NPU acceleration for text generation - now it is possible to deploy LLM and VLM models
		 on NPU accelerator. Text generation will be exposed over completions and chat/completions
		 endpoints. From the client perspective it works the same way as in GPU and CPU deployment,
		 however it doesn't use the continuous batching algorithm, and target is AI PC use cases
		 with low concurrency.

	* Other improvements

	  * Model management improvements - mediapipe graphs and generative endpoints can be now
		 started just using command line parameters without the configuration file. Configuration
		 file Json structure for models and graphs has been unified under the
		 `models_config_list` section.
	  * Updated scalability demonstration using multiple instances, see
		 `the demo <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server/tree/releases/2025/1/demos/continuous_batching/scaling>`__.
	  * Increased allowed number of stop words in a request from 4 to 16.
	  * Integration with the Visual Studio Code extension of Continue has been enabled making
		 it possible to use the assistance of local AI service while writing code.
	  * Performance improvements - enhancements in OpenVINO Runtime and also text sampling
		 generation algorithm which should increase the throughput in high concurrency load
		 scenarios.

	* Breaking changes

	  * gRPC server is now optional. There is no default gRPC port set. The ``--port`` parameter
		 is mandatory to start the gRPC server. It is possible to start REST API server only with
		 the ``--rest_port`` parameter. At least one port number needs to be defined to start
		 OVMS server from CLI (--port or --rest_port). Starting OVMS server via C API calls does
		 not require any port to be defined.

	* The following issues have been fixed:

	  * Handling of the LLM context length - OVMS will now stop generating the text when model
		 context is exceeded. An error will be raised when the prompt is longer from the context
		 or when the max_tokens plus the input tokens exceeds the model context.
		 In addition, it is possible to constrain the max number of generated tokens for all
		 users of the model.
	  * Security and stability improvements.
	  * Cancellation of LLM generation without streaming.

	* Known limitations

	  * `Chat/completions` accepts images encoded to base64 format but not as URL links.

	**Neural Network Compression Framework**

	* Preview support for the Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with LoRA adapters for more
	  accurate 4-bit weight compression of LLMs in PyTorch. The ``nncf.compress_weight`` API has
	  been extended by a new ``compression_format`` option: ``CompressionFormat.FQ_LORA``, for this
	  QAT method. To see how it works, see
	  `the sample <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/tree/develop/examples/llm_compression/torch/qat_with_lora>`__.
	* Added Activation-aware Weight Quantization and Scale Estimation data-aware 4-bit compression
	  methods for PyTorch backend. Now the compression of LLMs can directly be applied to PyTorch
	  models to speed up the process.
	* Reduced Generative Pre-trained Transformers Quantization (GPTQ) compression time and peak
	  memory usage.
	* Reduced compression time and peak memory usage of data-free mixed precision weight
	  compression.
	* New tracing for PyTorch models based on TorchFunctionMode for ``nncf.quantize`` and
	  ``nncf.compress_weights``, which does not require torch namespace fixes.
	  Disabled by default, it can be enabled by the environment variable ``"NNCF_EXPERIMENTAL_TORCH_TRACING=1”``.
	* Multiple improvements in TorchFX backend to comply with the Torch AO guidelines:

	  * The constant folding pass is removed from the OpenVINO Quantizer and the  ``quantize_pt2e``
		 function.
	  * Support for dynamic shape TorchFX models.

	* Initial steps to adopt custom quantizers in quantize_pt2e within NNCF:

	  * The hardware configuration is generalized with the narrow_range parameter.
	  * The quantizer parameter calculation code is refactored to explicitly depend on narrow_range.

	* Preview support of the OpenVINO backend in `ExecuTorch <https://github.com/pytorch/executorch>`__
	  has been introduced, model quantization is implemented via the function:
	  `nncf.experimental.torch.fx.quantize_pt2e <https://openvinotoolkit.github.io/nncf/autoapi/nncf/experimental/torch/fx/index.html#nncf.experimental.torch.fx.quantize_pt2e>`__.
	* PyTorch version 2.6 is now supported.

	**OpenVINO Tokenizers**

	* Support for Unigram tokenization models.
	* Build OpenVINO Tokenizers with installed ICU (International Components for Unicode)
	  plugin for reduced binary size.
	* max_length and padding rule parameters can be dynamically adjusted with Tokenizer class
	  from OpenVINO GenAI.
	* Remove fast_tokenizer dependency, no core_tokenizers binary in the OpenVINO Tokenizers
	  distribution anymore.

	**OpenVINO.GenAI**

	* The following has been added:

	  * Preview support for the Token Eviction mechanism for more efficient KVCache memory
		 management of LLMs during text generation. Disabled by default.
		 `See the sample <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai/blob/master/site/docs/concepts/optimization-techniques/kvcache-eviction-algorithm.md>`__.
	  * LLMPipeline C bindings and JavaScript bindings.
	  * StreamerBase::write(int64_t token) and
		 StreamerBase::write(const std::vector<int64_t>& tokens).
	  * Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct and Phi-3.5-vision-instruct support for VLMPipeline.
	  * Added Image2image and inpainting pipelines that support FLUX and Stable-Diffusion-3.

	* LLMPipeline now uses Paged Attention backend by default.
	* Streaming is now performed in a separate thread while the next token is being inferred by LLM.
	* Chat template is applied even with disabled chat mode. Use the ``apply_chat_template`` flag
	  to disable chat template in GenerationConfig.
	* Time consuming methods now release Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).

Deprecation And Support
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Using deprecated features and components is not advised. They are available to enable a smooth
transition to new solutions and will be discontinued in the future.
For more details, refer to:
`OpenVINO Legacy Features and Components <https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/documentation/legacy-features.html>`__.



Discontinued in 2025
-----------------------------

* Runtime components:

  * The OpenVINO property of Affinity API is no longer available. It has been replaced with CPU binding configurations (``ov::hint::enable_cpu_pinning``).
  * The openvino-nightly PyPI module has been discontinued. End-users should proceed with the Simple PyPI nightly repo instead. More information in `Release Policy <https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/about-openvino/release-notes-openvino/release-policy.html#nightly-releases>`__.
  * Binary operations Node API has been removed from Python API after previous deprecation. 

* Tools:

  * The OpenVINO™ Development Tools package (pip install openvino-dev) is no longer available for OpenVINO releases in 2025.
  * Model Optimizer is no longer available. Consider using the :doc:`new conversion methods <../openvino-workflow/model-preparation/convert-model-to-ir>` instead. For more details, see the `model conversion transition guide <https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/documentation/legacy-features/transition-legacy-conversion-api.html>`__.
  * Intel® Streaming SIMD Extensions (Intel® SSE) are currently not enabled in the binary package by default. They are still supported in the source code form.
  * Legacy prefixes: ``l_``, ``w_``, and ``m_`` have been removed from OpenVINO archive names.

* OpenVINO GenAI:

  * StreamerBase::put(int64_t token)
  * The ``Bool`` value for Callback streamer is no longer accepted. It must now return one of three values of StreamingStatus enum.
  * ChunkStreamerBase is deprecated. Use StreamerBase instead.

* NNCF ``create_compressed_model()`` method is now deprecated. ``nncf.quantize()`` method is recommended for Quantization-Aware Training of PyTorch and TensorFlow models.

* Deprecated OpenVINO Model Server (OVMS) benchmark client in C++ using TensorFlow Serving API.







Deprecated and to be removed in the future
--------------------------------------------
* Python 3.9 is now deprecated and will be unavailable after OpenVINO version 2025.4.
* ``openvino.Type.undefined`` is now deprecated and will be removed with version 2026.0.
  ``openvino.Type.dynamic`` should be used instead.
* APT & YUM Repositories Restructure:
  Starting with release 2025.1, users can switch to the new repository structure for APT and YUM,
  which no longer uses year-based subdirectories (like “2025”). The old (legacy) structure will
  still be available until 2026, when the change will be finalized.
  Detailed instructions are available on the relevant documentation pages:

  * `Installation guide - yum <https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/get-started/install-openvino/install-openvino-yum.html>`__
  * `Installation guide - apt <https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/get-started/install-openvino/install-openvino-apt.html>`__

* OpenCV binaries will be removed from Docker images in 2026.
* The `openvino` namespace of the OpenVINO Python API has been redesigned, removing the nested
  `openvino.runtime` module. The old namespace is now considered deprecated and will be
  discontinued in 2026.0. A new namespace structure is available for immediate migration.
  Details will be provided through warnings and documentation.
* Starting with the next release, manylinux2014 will be upgraded to manylinux_2_28. This aligns with modern toolchain requirements but also means that CentOS 7 will no longer be supported due to glibc incompatibility.
* With the release of Node.js v22, updated Node.js bindings are now available and compatible with the latest LTS version. These bindings do not support CentOS 7, as they rely on newer system libraries unavailable on legacy systems.
