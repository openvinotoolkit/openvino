Get Started with Samples
========================


.. meta::
   :description: Learn the details on the workflow of Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™
                 toolkit, and how to run inference, using provided code samples.


To use OpenVINO samples, install OpenVINO using one of the following distributions:

* Archive files (recommended) - :doc:`Linux <openvino_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_from_archive_linux>` | :doc:`Windows <openvino_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_from_archive_windows>` | :doc:`macOS <openvino_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_from_archive_macos>`
* :doc:`APT <openvino_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_apt>` or :doc:`YUM <openvino_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_yum>` for Linux
* :doc:`Docker image <openvino_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_docker>`
* `Build from source <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/docs/dev/build.md>`__

If you install OpenVINO Runtime via archive files, sample applications are created in the following directories:

* ``<INSTALL_DIR>/samples/python``
* ``<INSTALL_DIR>/samples/cpp``
* ``<INSTALL_DIR>/samples/c``

.. note::
   If you install OpenVINO without samples, you can still get them directly from `the OpenVINO repository <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/>`__.

Before you build samples, refer to the :doc:`system requirements <system_requirements>` page and make sure that all the prerequisites have been installed. Next, you can perform the following steps:

1. :ref:`Build Samples <build-samples>`.
2. :ref:`Select a Sample <select-sample>`.
3. :ref:`Download a suitable model <download-model>`.
4. :ref:`Download media files used as input, if necessary <download-media>`.

Once you perform all the steps, you can :ref:`run inference with the chosen sample application <run-inference>` to see the results.

.. _build-samples:

Build the Sample Applications
================================

Select a sample you want to use from the :doc:`OpenVINO Samples <openvino_docs_OV_UG_Samples_Overview>` page, and follow the instructions below to build it in your operating system.

.. note::

   Some samples may also require `OpenCV <https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/BuildOpenCV4OpenVINO>`__ to run properly. Make sure to install it for use with vision-oriented samples.

Instructions below show how to build sample applications with CMake. If you are interested in building them from source, check the `build instructions on GitHub <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/docs/dev/build.md>`__ .

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Linux
      :sync: linux


      .. tab-set::

         .. tab-item:: Python
            :sync: python

            Each Python sample directory contains the ``requirements.txt`` file, which you must install before running the sample:

            .. code-block:: sh

               cd <INSTALL_DIR>/samples/python/<SAMPLE_DIR>
               python3 -m pip install -r ./requirements.txt

         .. tab-item:: C and C++
            :sync: cpp

            To build the C or C++ sample applications for Linux, go to the ``<INSTALL_DIR>/samples/c`` or ``<INSTALL_DIR>/samples/cpp`` directory, respectively, and run the ``build_samples.sh`` script:

            .. code-block:: sh

               build_samples.sh

            Once the build is completed, you can find sample binaries in the following folders:

            * C samples: ``~/openvino_c_samples_build/<architecture>/Release``
            * C++ samples: ``~/openvino_cpp_samples_build/<architecture>/Release`` where the <architecture> is the output of ``uname -m``, for example, ``intel64``, ``armhf``, or ``aarch64``.

            You can also build the sample applications manually:

            .. note::

               If you have installed the product as a root user, switch to root mode before you continue: ``sudo -i`` .

            1. Navigate to a directory that you have write access to and create a samples build directory. This example uses a directory named ``build``:

               .. code-block:: sh

                  mkdir build

               .. note::

                  If you ran the Image Classification verification script during the installation, the C++ samples build directory is created in your home directory: ``~/openvino_cpp_samples_build/``

            2. Go to the created directory:

               .. code-block:: sh

                  cd build

            3. Run CMake to generate the Make files for release configuration. For example, for C++ samples:

               .. code-block:: sh

                  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release <INSTALL_DIR>/samples/cpp


            4. Run ``make`` to build the samples:

               .. code-block:: sh

                  cmake --build . --parallel

            For the release configuration, the sample application binaries are in ``<path_to_build_directory>/<architecture>/Release/``;
            for the debug configuration — in ``<path_to_build_directory>/<architecture>/Debug/``.

   .. tab-item:: Windows
      :sync: windows

      .. tab-set::

         .. tab-item:: Python
            :sync: python

            Each Python sample directory contains the ``requirements.txt`` file, which you must install before running the sample:

            .. code-block:: sh

               cd <INSTALL_DIR>\samples\python\<SAMPLE_DIR>
               python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

         .. tab-item:: C and C++
            :sync: c-cpp

            .. note::

               If you want to use Microsoft Visual Studio 2019, you are required to install CMake 3.14 or higher.

            To build the C or C++ sample applications on Windows, go to the ``<INSTALL_DIR>\samples\c`` or ``<INSTALL_DIR>\samples\cpp`` directory, respectively, and run the ``build_samples_msvc.bat`` batch file:

            .. code-block:: sh

               build_samples_msvc.bat

            By default, the script automatically detects the highest Microsoft Visual Studio version installed on the machine and uses it to create and build a solution for a sample code

            Once the build is completed, you can find sample binaries in the following folders:

            * C samples: ``C:\Users\<user>\Documents\Intel\OpenVINO\openvino_c_samples_build\<architecture>\Release``
            * C++ samples: ``C:\Users\<user>\Documents\Intel\OpenVINO\openvino_cpp_samples_build\<architecture>\Release`` where the <architecture> is the output of ``echo PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE%``, for example, ``intel64`` (AMD64), or ``arm64``.

            You can also build a generated solution manually. For example, if you want to build C++ sample binaries in Debug configuration, run the appropriate version of the Microsoft Visual Studio and open the generated solution file from the ``C:\Users\<user>\Documents\Intel\OpenVINO\openvino_cpp_samples_build\Samples.sln`` directory.

   .. tab-item:: macOS
      :sync: macos

      .. tab-set::

         .. tab-item:: Python
            :sync: python

            Each Python sample directory contains the ``requirements.txt`` file, which you must install before running the sample:

            .. code-block:: sh

               cd <INSTALL_DIR>/samples/python/<SAMPLE_DIR>
               python3 -m pip install -r ./requirements.txt

         .. tab-item:: C and C++
            :sync: cpp

            .. note::

               For building samples from the open-source version of OpenVINO toolkit, see the `build instructions on GitHub <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/docs/dev/build.md>`__ .

            To build the C or C++ sample applications for macOS, go to the ``<INSTALL_DIR>/samples/c`` or ``<INSTALL_DIR>/samples/cpp`` directory, respectively, and run the ``build_samples.sh`` script:

            .. code-block:: sh

               build_samples.sh

            Once the build is completed, you can find sample binaries in the following folders:

            * C samples: ``~/openvino_c_samples_build/<architecture>/Release``
            * C++ samples: ``~/openvino_cpp_samples_build/<architecture>/Release``

            You can also build the sample applications manually. Before proceeding, make sure you have OpenVINO™ environment set correctly. This can be done manually by:

            .. code-block:: sh

               cd <INSTALL_DIR>/
               source setupvars.sh

            .. note::

               If you have installed the product as a root user, switch to root mode before you continue: ``sudo -i``

            1. Navigate to a directory that you have write access to and create a samples build directory. This example uses a directory named ``build``:

               .. code-block:: sh

                  mkdir build

               .. note::

                  If you ran the Image Classification verification script during the installation, the C++ samples build directory was already created in your home directory: ``~/openvino_cpp_samples_build/``

            2. Go to the created directory:

               .. code-block:: sh

                  cd build

            3. Run CMake to generate the Make files for release configuration. For example, for C++ samples:

               .. code-block:: sh

                  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release <INSTALL_DIR>/samples/cpp


            4. Run ``make`` to build the samples:

               .. code-block:: sh

                  make

            For the release configuration, the sample application binaries are in ``<path_to_build_directory>/<architecture>/Release/``; for the debug configuration — in ``<path_to_build_directory>/<architecture>/Debug/``.


.. _select-sample:

Sample Application Setup
================================

First, select a sample from the :doc:`Sample Overview <openvino_docs_OV_UG_Samples_Overview>` and read the dedicated article to learn how to run it.

.. _download-model:

Download the Models
--------------------

You need a model that is specific for your inference task. You can get it from one of model repositories, such as TensorFlow Zoo, HuggingFace, or TensorFlow Hub.


Convert the Model
--------------------

If Your model requires conversion, check the `article <https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.3/openvino_docs_get_started_get_started_demos.html>`__ for information how to do it.

.. _download-media:

Download a Media to use
-----------------------

Most of the samples require you to provide an image or a video as input for the model. OpenVINO provides several sample images and videos for you to run code samples and demo applications:

- `Sample images and video <https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/data/test_data/>`__
- `Sample videos <https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/sample-videos>`__

To run the sample applications, you can use images and videos from the media files collection available `here <https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/data/test_data>`__ . As an alternative, you can get them from sites like `Pexels <https://pexels.com>`__ or `Google Images <https://images.google.com>`__ .

.. _run-inference:

Run Inference on a Sample
================================

To run the code sample with an input image using the IR model:


1. Set up the OpenVINO environment variables:

   .. tab-set::

      .. tab-item:: Linux
         :sync: linux

         .. code-block:: sh

            source  <INSTALL_DIR>/setupvars.sh

      .. tab-item:: Windows
         :sync: windows

         .. code-block:: bat

            <INSTALL_DIR>\setupvars.bat

      .. tab-item:: macOS
         :sync: macos

         .. code-block:: sh

            source <INSTALL_DIR>/setupvars.sh

2. Go to the code samples release directory created when you built the samples earlier:

   .. tab-set::

      .. tab-item:: Linux
         :sync: linux

         .. code-block:: sh

            cd ~/openvino_cpp_samples_build/intel64/Release

      .. tab-item:: Windows
         :sync: windows

         .. code-block:: bat

            cd  %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Intel\OpenVINO\openvino_samples_build\intel64\Release

      .. tab-item:: macOS
         :sync: macos

         .. code-block:: sh

            cd ~/openvino_cpp_samples_build/intel64/Release

3. Run the code sample executable, specifying the input media file, the IR for your model, and a target device for performing inference:


   .. tab-set::

      .. tab-item:: Python
         :sync: python

         .. tab-set::

            .. tab-item:: Linux
               :sync: linux

               .. code-block:: sh

                  python <sample.py file> -m <path_to_model> -i <path_to_media> -d <target_device>

            .. tab-item:: Windows
               :sync: windows

               .. code-block:: bat

                  python <sample.py file> -m <path_to_model> -i <path_to_media> -d <target_device>

            .. tab-item:: macOS
               :sync: macos

               .. code-block:: sh

                  python <sample.py file> -m <path_to_model> -i <path_to_media> -d <target_device>

      .. tab-item:: C++
         :sync: cpp

         .. tab-set::

            .. tab-item:: Linux
               :sync: linux

               .. code-block:: sh

                  <sample.exe file> -i <path_to_media> -m <path_to_model> -d <target_device>

            .. tab-item:: Windows
               :sync: windows

               .. code-block:: bat

                  <sample.exe file> -i <path_to_media> -m <path_to_model> -d <target_device>

            .. tab-item:: macOS
               :sync: macos

               .. code-block:: sh

                  <sample.exe file> -i <path_to_media> -m <path_to_model> -d <target_device>


Examples
================================

Running Inference on CPU
------------------------

The following command shows how to run the Image Classification Code Sample using the `dog.bmp <https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/data/test_data/images/224x224/dog.bmp>`__ file as an input image, the model in IR format from the ``ir`` directory, and the CPU as the target hardware:

.. note::

   * Running inference on Intel® Processor Graphics (GPU) requires :doc:`additional hardware configuration steps <openvino_docs_install_guides_configurations_for_intel_gpu>`, as described earlier on this page.
   * Running on GPU is not compatible with macOS.
