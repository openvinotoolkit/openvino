   :description: Learn how to install OpenVINO™ Runtime on macOS operating
                 system, using an archive file.


.. note::

   Note that the Archive distribution:

   * offers both C/C++ and Python APIs
   * additionally includes code samples
   * is dedicated to macOS users (archives for other systems are also available)
   * is only supported for CPU Plugin

   Before installing OpenVINO, see the
   :doc:`System Requirements page <../../../about-openvino/release-notes-openvino/system-requirements>`.


Installing OpenVINO Runtime
###########################

Step 1: Install OpenVINO Core Components
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


1. Open a command prompt terminal window.
2. Create the ``/opt/intel`` folder for OpenVINO by using the following command. If the folder already exists, skip this command.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo mkdir /opt/intel


   .. note::

      The ``/opt/intel`` path is the recommended folder path for installing OpenVINO. You may use a different path if desired.


3. Browse to the current user's ``Downloads`` folder:

   .. code-block:: sh

      cd <user_home>/Downloads


4. Download the `OpenVINO Runtime archive file for macOS <https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/repositories/openvino/packages/2024.5/macos/>`__, extract the files, rename the extracted folder and move it to the desired path:

   .. tab-set::

      .. tab-item:: x86, 64-bit
         :sync: x86-64

         .. code-block:: sh


            curl -L https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/repositories/openvino/packages/2024.5/macos/m_openvino_toolkit_macos_12_6_2024.5.0.17288.7975fa5da0c_x86_64.tgz --output openvino_2024.5.0.tgz
            tar -xf openvino_2024.5.0.tgz
            sudo mv m_openvino_toolkit_macos_12_6_2024.5.0.17288.7975fa5da0c_x86_64 /opt/intel/openvino_2024.5.0

      .. tab-item:: ARM, 64-bit
         :sync: arm-64

         .. code-block:: sh


            curl -L https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/repositories/openvino/packages/2024.5/macos/m_openvino_toolkit_macos_12_6_2024.5.0.17288.7975fa5da0c_arm64.tgz --output openvino_2024.5.0.tgz
            tar -xf openvino_2024.5.0.tgz
            sudo mv m_openvino_toolkit_macos_12_6_2024.5.0.17288.7975fa5da0c_arm64 /opt/intel/openvino_2024.5.0


5. (Optional) Install *numpy* Python Library:

   .. note::

      This step is required only when you decide to use Python API.

   You can use the ``requirements.txt`` file from the ``/opt/intel/openvino_2024.5.0/python`` folder:

   .. code-block:: sh

      cd /opt/intel/openvino_2024.5.0
      python3 -m pip install -r ./python/requirements.txt

6. For simplicity, it is useful to create a symbolic link as below:

   .. code-block:: sh


      sudo ln -s /opt/intel/openvino_2024.5.0 /opt/intel/openvino_2024


   .. note::

      If you have already installed a previous release of OpenVINO 2024, a symbolic link to the ``openvino_2024`` folder may already exist. Unlink the previous link with ``sudo unlink openvino_2024``, and then re-run the command above.


Congratulations, you have finished the installation! For some use cases you may still
need to install additional components. Check the description below, as well as the
:doc:`list of additional configurations <../configurations>`
to see if your case needs any of them.

The ``/opt/intel/openvino_2024`` folder now contains the core components for OpenVINO.
If you used a different path in Step 2, for example, ``/home/<USER>/intel/``,
OpenVINO is now in ``/home/<USER>/intel/openvino_2024``. The path to the ``openvino_2024``
directory is also referred as ``<INSTALL_DIR>`` throughout the OpenVINO documentation.


Step 2: Configure the Environment
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You must update several environment variables before you can compile and run OpenVINO applications. Open a terminal window and run the ``setupvars.sh``
script as shown below to temporarily set your environment variables. If your ``<INSTALL_DIR>`` (the folder you used to install OpenVINO) is not
the default ``/opt/intel/openvino_2024``, use the correct one instead.

.. code-block:: sh

   cd /opt/intel/openvino_2024
   source /opt/intel/openvino_2024/setupvars.sh


If you have more than one OpenVINO™ version on your machine, you can easily switch its version by sourcing the ``setupvars.sh`` of your choice.

.. note::

   The above command must be re-run every time you start a new terminal session. To set up macOS to automatically run the command every time a new terminal is opened, open ``~/.zshrc`` in your favorite editor and add ``source /opt/intel/openvino_2024/setupvars.sh`` after the last line. Next time when you open a terminal, you will see ``[setupvars.sh] OpenVINO™ environment initialized``. Changing ``~/.zshrc`` is not recommended when you have multiple OpenVINO versions on your machine and want to switch among them.

Uninstalling Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit
#####################################################

If you have installed OpenVINO Runtime from archive files, you can uninstall it by deleting the archive files and the extracted folders.
Uninstallation removes all Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit component files but does not affect user files in the installation directory.

If you have created the symbolic link, remove the link first:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo rm /opt/intel/openvino_2024

To delete the files:

.. code-block:: sh

   rm -r <extracted_folder> && rm <path_to_archive>
