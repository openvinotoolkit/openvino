# Configurations for Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2 {#openvino_docs_install_guides_configurations_for_ncs2}


Once you have your OpenVINO™ installed, follow the steps to be able to work on NCS2:

1. Go to the install_dependencies directory:
   ```sh
   cd <INSTALL_DIR>/install_dependencies/
   ```
2. Run the `install_NCS_udev_rules.sh` script:
   ```
   ./install_NCS_udev_rules.sh
   ```
3. You may need to reboot your machine for this to take effect.

You've completed all required configuration steps to perform inference on Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2.
