# OpenVINO™ Ecosystem Overview {#openvino_ecosystem}


OpenVINO™ is not just one tool. It is an expansive ecosystem of utilities, providing a comprehensive workflow for deep learning solution development. Learn more about each of them to reach the full potential of OpenVINO™ Toolkit.

### OpenVINO™ Model Server (OVMS)	   
OpenVINO Model Server is a scalable, high-performance solution for serving deep learning models optimized for Intel® architectures. The server uses Inference Engine libraries as a backend and exposes gRPC and HTTP/REST interfaces for inference that are fully compatible with TensorFlow Serving.

### Neural Network Compression Framework (NNCF)
A suite of advanced algorithms for Neural Network inference optimization with minimal accuracy drop. NNCF applies quantization, filter pruning, binarization and sparsity algorithms to PyTorch and TensorFlow models during training.

### OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow (OVTF)
A solution empowering TensorFlow developers with OpenVINO's optimization capabilities. With just two lines of code in your application, you can offload inference to OpenVINO, while keeping the TensorFlow API.

### DL Workbench
A web-based tool for deploying deep learning models. Built on the core of OpenVINO and equipped with a graphics user interface, DL Workbench is a great way to explore the possibilities of the OpenVINO workflow, import, analyze, optimize, and build your pre-trained models. You can do all that by visiting [Intel® DevCloud for the Edge](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/devcloud.html) and launching DL Workbench on-line.
