# Introduction to OpenVINO Deployment {#openvino_docs_deployment_guide_introduction}


Once you have a model that meets both OpenVINO™ and your requirements, you can choose among several ways of deploying it with your application: 
* [Run inference and develop your app with OpenVINO™ Runtime](../OV_Runtime_UG/openvino_intro.md).
* [Deploy your application locally](../OV_Runtime_UG/deployment/deployment_intro.md).
* [Deploy your model online, with the OpenVINO Model Server](@ref ovms_what_is_openvino_model_server).
