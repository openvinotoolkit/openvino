The [Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/openvino-toolkit.html) helps accelerate deep learning inference across a variety of Intel® processors and accelerators.

The benchmarks below demonstrate high performance gains on several public neural networks on multiple Intel® CPUs, GPUs and VPUs covering a broad performance range. Use this data to help you decide which hardware is best for your applications and solutions, or to plan your AI workload on the Intel computing already included in your solutions. To learn how to benchmark your own model in OpenVINO, visit the [benchmark_app documentation](../../samples/cpp/benchmark_app/README.md).

Use the links below to review the benchmarking results for each alternative:

* [OpenVINO™ Model Server Benchmark Results](performance_benchmarks_ovms.md)

Performance for a particular application can also be evaluated virtually using [Intel® DevCloud for the Edge](https://devcloud.intel.com/edge/), a remote development environment with access to Intel® hardware and the latest versions of the Intel® Distribution of the OpenVINO™ Toolkit.
