Typo Detector with OpenVINO™
============================

Typo detection in AI is a process of identifying and correcting
typographical errors in text data using machine learning algorithms. The
goal of typo detection is to improve the accuracy, readability, and
usability of text by identifying and indicating mistakes made during the
writing process. To detect typos, AI-based typo detectors use various
techniques, such as natural language processing (NLP), machine learning
(ML), and deep learning (DL).

A typo detector takes a sentence as an input and identify all
typographical errors such as misspellings and homophone errors.

This tutorial provides how to use the `Typo
Detector <https://huggingface.co/m3hrdadfi/typo-detector-distilbert-en>`__
from the `Hugging Face
Transformers <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index>`__ library
in the OpenVINO environment to perform the above task.

The model detects typos in a given text with a high accuracy,
performances of which are listed below,

- Precision score of 0.9923
- Recall score of 0.9859
- f1-score of 0.9891

`Source for above
metrics <https://huggingface.co/m3hrdadfi/typo-detector-distilbert-en>`__

These metrics indicate that the model can correctly identify a high
proportion of both correct and incorrect text, minimizing both false
positives and false negatives.

The model has been pretrained on the
`NeuSpell <https://github.com/neuspell/neuspell>`__ dataset.

Methods
~~~~~~~



The notebook provides two methods to run the inference of typo detector
with OpenVINO runtime, so that you can experience both calling the API
of Optimum with OpenVINO Runtime included, and loading models in other
frameworks, converting them to OpenVINO IR format, and running inference
with OpenVINO Runtime.

1. Using the `Hugging Face Optimum <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/index>`__ library
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''



The Hugging Face Optimum API is a high-level API that allows us to
convert models from the Hugging Face Transformers library to the
OpenVINO™ IR format. Compiled models in OpenVINO IR format can be loaded
using Optimum. Optimum allows the use of optimization on targeted
hardware.

2. Converting the model to OpenVINO IR
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''



The Pytorch model is converted to `OpenVINO IR
format <https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/documentation/openvino-ir-format.html>`__.
This method provides much more insight to how to set up a pipeline from
model loading to model converting, compiling and running inference with
OpenVINO, so that you could conveniently use OpenVINO to optimize and
accelerate inference for other deep-learning models. The optimization of
targeted hardware is also used here.

The following table summarizes the major differences between the two
methods

+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

    r = requests.get(

    device = device_widget()

1. Hugging Face Optimum Intel library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



For this method, we need to install the
``Hugging Face Optimum Intel library`` accelerated by OpenVINO
integration.

Optimum Intel can be used to load optimized models from the `Hugging
Face Hub <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/hf.co/models>`__ and
create pipelines to run an inference with OpenVINO Runtime using Hugging
Face APIs. The Optimum Inference models are API compatible with Hugging
Face Transformers models. This means we need just replace
``AutoModelForXxx`` class with the corresponding ``OVModelForXxx``
class.

Import required model class

.. code:: ipython3

    from optimum.intel.openvino import OVModelForTokenClassification

Load the model
''''''''''''''



From the ``OVModelForTokenCLassification`` class we will import the
relevant pre-trained model. To load a Transformers model and convert it
to the OpenVINO format on-the-fly, we set ``export=True`` when loading
your model.

.. code:: ipython3

    # The pretrained model we are using
    model_id = "m3hrdadfi/typo-detector-distilbert-en"

    model_dir = Path("optimum_model")

    # Save the model to the path if not existing
    if model_dir.exists():
        model = OVModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(model_dir, device=device.value)
    else:
        model = OVModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(model_id, export=True, device=device.value)
        model.save_pretrained(model_dir)

Load the tokenizer
''''''''''''''''''



Text Preprocessing cleans the text-based input data so it can be fed
into the model. Tokenization splits paragraphs and sentences into
smaller units that can be more easily assigned meaning. It involves
cleaning the data and assigning tokens or IDs to the words, so they are
represented in a vector space where similar words have similar vectors.
This helps the model understand the context of a sentence. We’re making
use of an
`AutoTokenizer <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/tokenizer>`__
from Hugging Face, which is essentially a pretrained tokenizer.

.. code:: ipython3

    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)

Then we use the inference pipeline for ``token-classification`` task.
You can find more information about usage Hugging Face inference
pipelines in this
`tutorial <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/pipeline_tutorial>`__

.. code:: ipython3

    nlp = pipeline(
        "token-classification",
        model=model,
        tokenizer=tokenizer,
        aggregation_strategy="average",
    )

Function to find typos in a sentence and write them to the terminal

.. code:: ipython3

    def show_typos(sentence: str):
        """
        Detect typos from the given sentence.
        Writes both the original input and typo-tagged version to the terminal.

        Arguments:
        sentence -- Sentence to be evaluated (string)
        """

        typos = [sentence[r["start"] : r["end"]] for r in nlp(sentence)]

        detected = sentence
        for typo in typos:
            detected = detected.replace(typo, f"<i>{typo}</i>")

        print("[Input]: ", sentence)
        print("[Detected]: ", detected)
        print("-" * 130)

Let’s run a demo using the Hugging Face Optimum API.

2. Converting the model to OpenVINO IR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Load the Pytorch model
''''''''''''''''''''''



Use the ``AutoModelForTokenClassification`` class to load the pretrained
pytorch model.

.. code:: ipython3

    model_id = "m3hrdadfi/typo-detector-distilbert-en"
    model_dir = Path("pytorch_model")

    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
    config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(model_id)

    # Save the model to the path if not existing
    if model_dir.exists():
        model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(model_dir)
    else:
        model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(model_id, config=config)
        model.save_pretrained(model_dir)

Converting to OpenVINO IR
'''''''''''''''''''''''''



.. code:: ipython3

    import openvino as ov

    ov_model_path = Path(model_dir) / "typo_detect.xml"

    dummy_model_input = tokenizer("This is a sample", return_tensors="pt")
    ov_model = ov.convert_model(model, example_input=dict(dummy_model_input))
    ov.save_model(ov_model, ov_model_path)

Inference
'''''''''



OpenVINO™ Runtime Python API is used to compile the model in OpenVINO IR
format. The Core class from the ``openvino`` module is imported first.
This class provides access to the OpenVINO Runtime API. The ``core``
object, which is an instance of the ``Core`` class, represents the API
and it is used to compile the model. The output layer is extracted from
the compiled model as it is needed for inference.

.. code:: ipython3

    core = ov.Core()

    compiled_model = core.compile_model(ov_model, device.value)
    output_layer = compiled_model.output(0)
