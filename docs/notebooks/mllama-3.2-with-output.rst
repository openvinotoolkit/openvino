Visual-language assistant with Llama-3.2-11B-Vision and OpenVINO
================================================================

Llama-3.2-11B-Vision is the latest model from LLama3 model family those
capabilities extended to understand images content. The Llama 3.2-Vision
instruction-tuned models are optimized for visual recognition, image
reasoning, captioning, and answering general questions about an image.
Llama 3.2-Vision is built on top of Llama 3.1 text-only model, which is
an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer
architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align with human
preferences for helpfulness and safety. To support image recognition
tasks, the Llama 3.2-Vision model uses a separately trained vision
adapter that integrates with the pre-trained Llama 3.1 language model.
The adapter consists of a series of cross-attention layers that feed
image encoder representations into the core LLM.

In this tutorial we consider how to convert, optimize and run this model
using OpenVINO. More details about model can be found in `model
card <https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-models/blob/main/models/llama3_2/MODEL_CARD_VISION.md>`__,

Convert model
-------------



OpenVINO supports PyTorch models via conversion to OpenVINO Intermediate
Representation (IR). `OpenVINO model conversion
API <https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/openvino-workflow/model-preparation.html#convert-a-model-with-python-convert-model>`__
should be used for these purposes. ``ov.convert_model`` function accepts
original PyTorch model instance and example input for tracing and
returns ``ov.Model`` representing this model in OpenVINO framework.
Converted model can be used for saving on disk using ``ov.save_model``
function or directly loading on device using ``core.complie_model``.

``ov_mllama_helper.py`` script contains helper function for model
conversion, please check its content if you interested in conversion
details.

Click here for more detailed explanation of conversion steps
Llama-3.2.-Vision is autoregressive transformer generative model, it
means that each next model step depends from model output from previous
step. The generation approach is based on the assumption that the
probability distribution of a word sequence can be decomposed into the
product of conditional next word distributions. In other words, model
predicts the next token in the loop guided by previously generated
tokens until the stop-condition will be not reached (generated sequence
of maximum length or end of string token obtained). The way the next
token will be selected over predicted probabilities is driven by the
selected decoding methodology. You can find more information about the
most popular decoding methods in this
`blog <https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate>`__. The entry point
for the generation process for models from the Hugging Face Transformers
library is the ``generate`` method. You can find more information about
its parameters and configuration in the
`documentation <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.26.1/en/main_classes/text_generation#transformers.GenerationMixin.generate>`__.
To preserve flexibility in the selection decoding methodology, we will
convert only model inference for one step.

The inference flow has difference on first step and for the next. On the
first step, model accept preprocessed input instruction and image. Image
processed via ``Image Encoder`` to cross-attention state, after that
``language model``, LLM-based part of model, runs on cross-attention
states and tokenized input token ids to predict probability of next
generated tokens. On the next step, ``language_model`` accepts only next
token. Since the output side is auto-regressive, an output token hidden
state remains the same once computed for every further generation step.
Therefore, recomputing it every time you want to generate a new token
seems wasteful. With the cache, the model saves the hidden state once it
has been computed. The model only computes the one for the most recently
generated output token at each time step, re-using the saved ones for
hidden tokens. This reduces the generation complexity from
:math:`O(n^3)` to :math:`O(n^2)` for a transformer model. More details
about how it works can be found in this
`article <https://scale.com/blog/pytorch-improvements#Text%20Translation>`__.

With increasing model size like in modern LLMs, we also can note an
increase in the number of attention blocks and size past key values
tensors respectively. The strategy for handling cache state as model
inputs and outputs in the inference cycle may become a bottleneck for
memory-bounded systems, especially with processing long input sequences,
for example in a chatbot scenario. OpenVINO suggests a transformation
that removes inputs and corresponding outputs with cache tensors from
the model keeping cache handling logic inside the model. Such models are
also called stateful. A stateful model is a model that implicitly
preserves data between two consecutive inference calls. The tensors
saved from one run are kept in an internal memory buffer called a
``state`` or a ``variable`` and may be passed to the next run, while
never being exposed as model output. Hiding the cache enables storing
and updating the cache values in a more device-friendly representation.
It helps to reduce memory consumption and additionally optimize model
performance. More details about stateful models and working with state
can be found in `OpenVINO
documentation <https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/openvino-workflow/running-inference/stateful-models.html>`__.

``image_encoder`` is represented in Llama-3.2-Vision by pretrained VIT
model.

To sum up above, model consists of 2 parts:

-  **Image Encoder** for encoding input images into LLM cross attention
   states space.
-  **Language Model** for generation answer based on cross attention
   states provided by Image Encoder and input tokens.

Letâ€™s convert each model part.

Optimize model using NNCF
-------------------------



Compress Language model weights in 4bits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



For reducing memory consumption, weights compression optimization can be
applied using `NNCF <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf>`__.

.. raw:: html

   <details>

Click here for more details about weight compression Weight compression
aims to reduce the memory footprint of a model. It can also lead to
significant performance improvement for large memory-bound models, such
as Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs and other models, which require
extensive memory to store the weights during inference, can benefit from
weight compression in the following ways:

-  enabling the inference of exceptionally large models that cannot be
   accommodated in the memory of the device;

-  improving the inference performance of the models by reducing the
   latency of the memory access when computing the operations with
   weights, for example, Linear layers.

`Neural Network Compression Framework
(NNCF) <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf>`__ provides 4-bit /
8-bit mixed weight quantization as a compression method primarily
designed to optimize LLMs. The main difference between weights
compression and full model quantization (post-training quantization) is
that activations remain floating-point in the case of weights
compression which leads to a better accuracy. Weight compression for
LLMs provides a solid inference performance improvement which is on par
with the performance of the full model quantization. In addition, weight
compression is data-free and does not require a calibration dataset,
making it easy to use.

``nncf.compress_weights`` function can be used for performing weights
compression. The function accepts an OpenVINO model and other
compression parameters. Compared to INT8 compression, INT4 compression
improves performance even more, but introduces a minor drop in
prediction quality.

More details about weights compression, can be found in `OpenVINO
documentation <https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/openvino-workflow/model-optimization-guide/weight-compression.html>`__.

In this tutorial we consider usage Data-Aware weights compression. Such
approaches may require more time and memory as they involves calibration
dataset, while promising better int4 model accuracy. > **Note:** AWQ
weight quantization requires at least 64GB RAM, if you run notebook in
memory-constrained environment, you can switch to data-free weight
compression using widget bellow

Optimize Vision model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



While weight compression is the great tool for large language models
memory footprint reduction, for smaller size models like Image Encoder,
it may be more efficient to apply INT8 Post-training quantization. You
can find more details about post-training quantization in `OpenVINO
documentation <https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/openvino-workflow/model-optimization-guide/quantizing-models-post-training.html>`__.

Basically model quantization process consists of 3 steps: 1. Prepare
quantization dataset 2. Perform model quantization using
``nncf.quantize`` 3. Save optimized model on disk using
``ov.save_model``

   **Note:** Model quantization may requires additional time and memory
   for optimization and be non-applicable for some devices. You can skip
   quantization step or replace it with weight compression using widget
   bellow if you does not have enough resources.

Model Inference
---------------



Now, we are ready to test model inference.
``OVOVMLlamaForConditionalGeneration`` defined in
``ov_mllama_helper.py`` has similar generation interface with original
model and additionally enables runtime optimizations for efficient model
inference with OpenVINO: - **Slicing LM head** - usually LLM models
provides probability for all input tokens, while for selection next
token, we are interested only for the last one. Reducing Language Model
head size to return only last token probability may provide better
performance and reduce memory consumption for the first inference, where
usually whole input prompt processed. You can find more details about
this optimization in `OpenVINO
blog <https://blog.openvino.ai/blog-posts/large-language-model-graph-customization-with-openvino-tm-transformations-api>`__
