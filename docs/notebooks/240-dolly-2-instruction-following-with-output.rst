Instruction following using Databricks Dolly 2.0 and OpenVINO
=============================================================

The instruction following is one of the cornerstones of the current
generation of large language models(LLMs). Reinforcement learning with
human preferences (`RLHF <https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08593>`__) and
techniques such as `InstructGPT <https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155>`__
has been the core foundation of breakthroughs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4.
However, these powerful models remain hidden behind APIs and we know
very little about their underlying architecture. Instruction-following
models are capable of generating text in response to prompts and are
often used for tasks like writing assistance, chatbots, and content
generation. Many users now interact with these models regularly and even
use them for work but the majority of such models remain closed-source
and require massive amounts of computational resources to experiment
with.

`Dolly
2.0 <https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/04/12/dolly-first-open-commercially-viable-instruction-tuned-llm>`__
is the first open-source, instruction-following LLM fine-tuned by
Databricks on a transparent and freely available dataset that is also
open-sourced to use for commercial purposes. That means Dolly 2.0 is
available for commercial applications without the need to pay for API
access or share data with third parties. Dolly 2.0 exhibits similar
characteristics so ChatGPT despite being much smaller.

In this tutorial, we consider how to run an instruction-following text
generation pipeline using Dolly 2.0 and OpenVINO. We will use a
pre-trained model from the `Hugging Face
Transformers <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index>`__
library. To simplify the user experience, the `Hugging Face Optimum
Intel <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/index>`__ library is
used to convert the models to OpenVINO™ IR format.

The tutorial consists of the following steps:

-  Install prerequisites
-  Download and convert the model from a public source using the
   `OpenVINO integration with Hugging Face
   Optimum <https://huggingface.co/blog/openvino>`__.
-  Compress model weights to INT8 with `OpenVINO
   NNCF <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf>`__
-  Create an instruction-following inference pipeline
-  Run instruction-following pipeline

About Dolly 2.0
---------------

Dolly 2.0 is an instruction-following large language model trained on
the Databricks machine-learning platform that is licensed for commercial
use. It is based on `Pythia <https://github.com/EleutherAI/pythia>`__
and is trained on ~15k instruction/response fine-tuning records
generated by Databricks employees in various capability domains,
including brainstorming, classification, closed QA, generation,
information extraction, open QA, and summarization. Dolly 2.0 works by
processing natural language instructions and generating responses that
follow the given instructions. It can be used for a wide range of
applications, including closed question-answering, summarization, and
generation.

The model training process was inspired by
`InstructGPT <https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155>`__. To train InstructGPT
models, the core technique is reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF), This technique uses human preferences as a reward signal to
fine-tune models, which is important as the safety and alignment
problems required to be solved are complex and subjective, and aren’t
fully captured by simple automatic metrics. More details about the
InstructGPT approach can be found in OpenAI `blog
post <https://openai.com/research/instruction-following>`__ The
breakthrough discovered with InstructGPT is that language models don’t
need larger and larger training sets. By using human-evaluated
question-and-answer training, authors were able to train a better
language model using one hundred times fewer parameters than the
previous model. Databricks used a similar approach to create a prompt
and response dataset called they call
`databricks-dolly-15k <https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/databricks-dolly-15k>`__,
a corpus of more than 15,000 records generated by thousands of
Databricks employees to enable large language models to exhibit the
magical interactivity of InstructGPT. More details about the model and
dataset can be found in `Databricks blog
post <https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/04/12/dolly-first-open-commercially-viable-instruction-tuned-llm>`__

Prerequisites
-------------



First, we should install the `Hugging Face
Optimum <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/installation>`__ library
accelerated by OpenVINO integration. The Hugging Face Optimum Intel API
is a high-level API that enables us to convert and quantize models from
the Hugging Face Transformers library to the OpenVINO™ IR format. For
more details, refer to the `Hugging Face Optimum Intel
documentation <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/inference>`__.

.. code:: ipython3

    %pip install -q "diffusers>=0.16.1" "transformers>=4.33.0" "openvino>=2023.2.0" "nncf>=2.6.0" onnx gradio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
    %pip install -q --upgrade "git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel.git" 

Select inference device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



select device from dropdown list for running inference using OpenVINO

.. code:: ipython3

    import ipywidgets as widgets
    import openvino as ov
    
    core = ov.Core()
    
    device = widgets.Dropdown(
        options=core.available_devices + ["AUTO"],
        value='CPU',
        description='Device:',
        disabled=False,
    )
    
    device




.. parsed-literal::

    Dropdown(description='Device:', options=('CPU', 'GPU', 'AUTO'), value='CPU')



Download and Convert Model
--------------------------



Optimum Intel can be used to load optimized models from the `Hugging
Face Hub <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/hf.co/models>`__ and
create pipelines to run an inference with OpenVINO Runtime using Hugging
Face APIs. The Optimum Inference models are API compatible with Hugging
Face Transformers models. This means we just need to replace
``AutoModelForXxx`` class with the corresponding ``OVModelForXxx``
class.

Below is an example of the Dolly model

.. code:: diff

   -from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
   +from optimum.intel.openvino import OVModelForCausalLM
   from transformers import AutoTokenizer, pipeline

   model_id = "databricks/dolly-v2-3b"
   -model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)
   +model = OVModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, from_transformers=True)

Model class initialization starts with calling ``from_pretrained``
method. When downloading and converting Transformers model, the
parameter ``export=True`` should be added. For models where size more We
can save the converted model for the next usage with the
``save_pretrained`` method. Tokenizer class and pipelines API are
compatible with Optimum models.

.. code:: ipython3

    from pathlib import Path
    from transformers import AutoTokenizer
    from optimum.intel.openvino import OVModelForCausalLM
    
    model_id = "databricks/dolly-v2-3b"
    model_path = Path("dolly-v2-3b")
    
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
    
    current_device = device.value
    
    ov_config = {'PERFORMANCE_HINT': 'LATENCY', 'NUM_STREAMS': '1', "CACHE_DIR": ""}
    
    if model_path.exists():
        ov_model = OVModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path, device=current_device, ov_config=ov_config)
    else:
        ov_model = OVModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device=current_device, export=True, ov_config=ov_config, load_in_8bit=False)
        ov_model.half()
        ov_model.save_pretrained(model_path)

NNCF model weights compression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



NNCF `Weights Compression
algorithm <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/blob/develop/docs/compression_algorithms/CompressWeights.md>`__
compresses weights of a model to ``INT8``. This is an alternative to
`Quantization
algorithm <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/blob/develop/docs/compression_algorithms/post_training/Quantization.md>`__
that compresses both weights and activations. Weight compression is
effective in optimizing footprint and performance of large models where
the size of weights is significantly larger than the size of
activations, for example, in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Dolly
2.0. Additionally, Weight Compression usually leads to almost no
accuracy drop.

.. code:: ipython3

    to_compress = widgets.Checkbox(
        value=True,
        description='INT8 Compression',
        disabled=False,
    )
    print("Click on checkbox for enabling / disabling weights compression")

Create an instruction-following inference pipeline
--------------------------------------------------



The ``run_generation`` function accepts user-provided text input,
tokenizes it, and runs the generation process. Text generation is an
iterative process, where each next token depends on previously generated
until a maximum number of tokens or stop generation condition is not
reached. To obtain intermediate generation results without waiting until
when generation is finished, we will use
`TextIteratorStreamer <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.TextIteratorStreamer>`__,
provided as part of HuggingFace `Streaming
API <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/generation_strategies#streaming>`__.

The diagram below illustrates how the instruction-following pipeline
works

.. figure:: https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/assets/29454499/e881f4a4-fcc8-427a-afe1-7dd80aebd66e
   :alt: generation pipeline)

   generation pipeline)

As can be seen, on the first iteration, the user provided instructions
converted to token ids using a tokenizer, then prepared input provided
to the model. The model generates probabilities for all tokens in logits
format The way the next token will be selected over predicted
probabilities is driven by the selected decoding methodology. You can
find more information about the most popular decoding methods in this
`blog <https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate>`__.

There are several parameters that can control text generation quality:

-  | ``Temperature`` is a parameter used to control the level of
     creativity in AI-generated text. By adjusting the ``temperature``,
     you can influence the AI model’s probability distribution, making
     the text more focused or diverse.
   | Consider the following example: The AI model has to complete the
     sentence “The cat is \____.” with the following token
     probabilities:

   | playing: 0.5
   | sleeping: 0.25
   | eating: 0.15
   | driving: 0.05
   | flying: 0.05

   -  **Low temperature** (e.g., 0.2): The AI model becomes more focused
      and deterministic, choosing tokens with the highest probability,
      such as “playing.”
   -  **Medium temperature** (e.g., 1.0): The AI model maintains a
      balance between creativity and focus, selecting tokens based on
      their probabilities without significant bias, such as “playing,”
      “sleeping,” or “eating.”
   -  **High temperature** (e.g., 2.0): The AI model becomes more
      adventurous, increasing the chances of selecting less likely
      tokens, such as “driving” and “flying.”

-  ``Top-p``, also known as nucleus sampling, is a parameter used to
   control the range of tokens considered by the AI model based on their
   cumulative probability. By adjusting the ``top-p`` value, you can
   influence the AI model’s token selection, making it more focused or
   diverse. Using the same example with the cat, consider the following
   top_p settings:

   -  **Low top_p** (e.g., 0.5): The AI model considers only tokens with
      the highest cumulative probability, such as “playing.”
   -  **Medium top_p** (e.g., 0.8): The AI model considers tokens with a
      higher cumulative probability, such as “playing,” “sleeping,” and
      “eating.”
   -  **High top_p** (e.g., 1.0): The AI model considers all tokens,
      including those with lower probabilities, such as “driving” and
      “flying.”

-  ``Top-k`` is another popular sampling strategy. In comparison with
   Top-P, which chooses from the smallest possible set of words whose
   cumulative probability exceeds the probability P, in Top-K sampling K
   most likely next words are filtered and the probability mass is
   redistributed among only those K next words. In our example with cat,
   if k=3, then only “playing”, “sleeping” and “eating” will be taken
   into account as possible next word.

To optimize the generation process and use memory more efficiently, the
``use_cache=True`` option is enabled. Since the output side is
auto-regressive, an output token hidden state remains the same once
computed for every further generation step. Therefore, recomputing it
every time you want to generate a new token seems wasteful. With the
cache, the model saves the hidden state once it has been computed. The
model only computes the one for the most recently generated output token
at each time step, re-using the saved ones for hidden tokens. This
reduces the generation complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2) for a
transformer model. More details about how it works can be found in this
`article <https://scale.com/blog/pytorch-improvements#Text%20Translation>`__.
With this option, the model gets the previous step’s hidden states
(cached attention keys and values) as input and additionally provides
hidden states for the current step as output. It means for all next
iterations, it is enough to provide only a new token obtained from the
previous step and cached key values to get the next token prediction.

The generation cycle repeats until the end of the sequence token is
reached or it also can be interrupted when maximum tokens will be
generated. As already mentioned before, we can enable printing current
generated tokens without waiting until when the whole generation is
finished using Streaming API, it adds a new token to the output queue
and then prints them when they are ready.

Run instruction-following pipeline
----------------------------------



Now, we are ready to explore model capabilities. This demo provides a
simple interface that allows communication with a model using text
instruction. Type your instruction into the ``User instruction`` field
or select one from predefined examples and click on the ``Submit``
button to start generation. Additionally, you can modify advanced
generation parameters:

-  ``Device`` - allows switching inference device. Please note, every
   time when new device is selected, model will be recompiled and this
   takes some time.
-  ``Max New Tokens`` - maximum size of generated text.
-  ``Top-p (nucleus sampling)`` - if set to < 1, only the smallest set
   of most probable tokens with probabilities that add up to top_p or
   higher are kept for a generation.
-  ``Top-k`` - the number of highest probability vocabulary tokens to
   keep for top-k-filtering.
-  ``Temperature`` - the value used to module the logits distribution.
