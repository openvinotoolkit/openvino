Zero-shot Image Classification with OpenAI CLIP and OpenVINO™
=============================================================

Zero-shot image classification is a computer vision task to classify
images into one of several classes without any prior training or
knowledge of the classes.

Zero-shot learning resolves several challenges in image retrieval
systems. For example, with the rapid growth of categories on the web, it
is challenging to index images based on unseen categories. We can
associate unseen categories to images with zero-shot learning by
exploiting attributes to model’s relationship between visual features
and labels. In this tutorial, we will use the `OpenAI
CLIP <https://github.com/openai/CLIP>`__ model to perform zero-shot
image classification. The notebook contains the following steps:

1. Download the model.
2. Instantiate the PyTorch model.
3. Convert model to OpenVINO IR, using model conversion API.
4. Run CLIP with OpenVINO.

Instantiate model

CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) is a neural network
trained on various (image, text) pairs. It can be instructed in natural
language to predict the most relevant text snippet, given an image,
without directly optimizing for the task. CLIP uses a
`ViT <https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929>`__ like transformer to get
visual features and a causal language model to get the text features.
The text and visual features are then projected into a latent space with
identical dimensions. The dot product between the projected image and
text features is then used as a similarity score.

You can find more information about this model in the `research
paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020>`__, `OpenAI

GitHub `repository <https://github.com/openai/CLIP>`__.

In this notebook, we will use
`openai/clip-vit-base-patch16 <https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-base-patch16>`__,
available via Hugging Face Transformers, but the same steps are
applicable for other CLIP family models.

First, we need to create ``CLIPModel`` class object and initialize it
with model configuration and weights, using ``from_pretrained`` method.
The model will be automatically downloaded from Hugging Face Hub and
cached for the next usage. ``CLIPProcessor`` class is a wrapper for
input data preprocessing. It includes both encoding the text using
tokenizer and preparing the images.

    from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel

    # load pre-trained model
    model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch16")

Run PyTorch model inference
---------------------------



To perform classification, define labels and load an image in RGB
format. To give the model wider text context and improve guidance, we
extend the labels description using the template “This is a photo of a”.
Both the list of label descriptions and image should be passed through
the processor to obtain a dictionary with input data in the
model-specific format. The model predicts an image-text similarity score
in raw logits format, which can be normalized to the ``[0, 1]`` range
using the ``softmax`` function. Then, we select labels with the highest
similarity score for the final result.

    from pathlib import Path

    from PIL import Image

    urlretrieve(
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/main/notebooks/228-clip-zero-shot-image-classification/visualize.py",

    logits_per_image = results['logits_per_image']  # this is the image-text similarity score

    visualize_result(image, input_labels, probs[0])

Convert model to OpenVINO Intermediate Representation (IR) format.
------------------------------------------------------------------



For best results with OpenVINO, it is recommended to convert the model
to OpenVINO IR format. OpenVINO supports PyTorch via Model conversion
API. To convert the PyTorch model to OpenVINO IR format we will use
``ov.convert_model`` of `model conversion
API <https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.3/openvino_docs_model_processing_introduction.html>`__.
The ``ov.convert_model`` Python function returns an OpenVINO Model
object ready to load on the device and start making predictions. We can
save it on disk for the next usage with ``ov.save_model``.

.. code:: ipython3

    import openvino as ov

    model.config.torchscript = True
    ov_model = ov.convert_model(model, example_input=dict(inputs))
    ov.save_model(ov_model, 'clip-vit-base-patch16.xml')

Run OpenVINO model
------------------



The steps for making predictions with the OpenVINO CLIP model are
similar to the PyTorch model. Let us check the model result using the
same input data from the example above with PyTorch.

.. code:: ipython3

    from scipy.special import softmax

    # create OpenVINO core object instance
    core = ov.Core()

Select inference device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



select device from dropdown list for running inference using OpenVINO

.. code:: ipython3

    import ipywidgets as widgets

    device = widgets.Dropdown(
        options=core.available_devices + ["AUTO"],
        value='AUTO',
        description='Device:',
        disabled=False,
    )

    device




.. parsed-literal::

    Dropdown(description='Device:', index=2, options=('CPU', 'GPU', 'AUTO'), value='AUTO')



.. code:: ipython3

    # compile model for loading on device
    compiled_model = core.compile_model(ov_model, device.value)
    # obtain output tensor for getting predictions
    logits_per_image_out = compiled_model.output(0)
    # run inference on preprocessed data and get image-text similarity score
    ov_logits_per_image = compiled_model(dict(inputs))[logits_per_image_out]
    # perform softmax on score
    probs = softmax(ov_logits_per_image, axis=1)
    # visualize prediction
    visualize_result(image, input_labels, probs[0])

Great! Looks like we got the same result.

Now, it is your turn! You can provide your own image and comma-separated
list of labels for zero-shot classification.

Feel free to upload an image, using the file upload window and type
label names into the text field, using comma as the separator (for
example, ``cat,dog,bird``)

.. code:: ipython3

    import gradio as gr


    def classify(image, text):
        """Classify image using classes listing.
        Args:
            image (np.ndarray): image that needs to be classified in CHW format.
            text (str): comma-separated list of class labels
        Returns:
            (dict): Mapping between class labels and class probabilities.
        """
        labels = text.split(",")
        text_descriptions = [f"This is a photo of a {label}" for label in labels]
        inputs = processor(text=text_descriptions, images=[image], return_tensors="np", padding=True)
        ov_logits_per_image = compiled_model(dict(inputs))[logits_per_image_out]
        probs = softmax(ov_logits_per_image, axis=1)[0]

        return {label: float(prob) for label, prob in zip(labels, probs)}


    demo = gr.Interface(
        classify,
        [
            gr.Image(label="Image", type="pil"),
            gr.Textbox(label="Labels", info="Comma-separated list of class labels"),
        ],
        gr.Label(label="Result"),
        examples=[[sample_path, "cat,dog,bird"]],
