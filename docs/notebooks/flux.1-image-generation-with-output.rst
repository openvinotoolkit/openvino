Image generation with Flux.1 and OpenVINO
=========================================

Flux is a AI image generation model developed by `Black Forest
Labs <https://blackforestlabs.ai/our-team/>`__. It represents a
significant advancement in AI-generated art, utilizing a hybrid
architecture of `multimodal <https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03206>`__ and
`parallel <https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05442>`__ `diffusion
transformer <https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09748>`__ blocks and scaled to
12B parameter. The model offers state-of-the-art performance image
generation with top of the line prompt following, visual quality, image
detail and output diversity.More details about model can be found in
`blog post <https://blackforestlabs.ai/announcing-black-forest-labs/>`__
and `original repo <https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux>`__

In this tutorial we consider how to convert and optimized Flux.1 model
using OpenVINO.

   **Note**: Some demonstrated models can require at least 32GB RAM for
   conversion and running.

We recommend running the notebook in a virtual environment. You only
need a Jupyter server to start. For details, please refer to
`Installation

Select model

To strike a balance between accessibility and model capabilities, FLUX.1
comes in three variants: FLUX.1-pro, FLUX.1-dev and FLUX.1-schnell: \*
**FLUX.1-pro**: The best of FLUX.1, offering state-of-the-art
performance image generation with top of the line prompt following,
visual quality, image detail and output diversity, but not available for
public usage. \* **FLUX.1-dev**: FLUX.1-dev is an open-weight,
guidance-distilled models. Directly distilled from FLUX.1-pro,
FLUX.1-dev obtains similar quality and prompt adherence capabilities,
while being more efficient than a standard model of the same size.
FLUX.1-dev weights are available on
`HuggingFace <https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev>`__.
\* **FLUX.1-schnell**: the fastest model from Flux family is tailored
for local development and personal use. FLUX.1-schnell is openly
available under an Apache2.0 license. Similar, FLUX.1-dev, weights are
available on
`HuggingFace <https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell>`__.

Be default, we will use FLUX.1-schnell model, but you can switch to
FLUX.1-dev version using widget bellow.

.. code:: ipython3

    import ipywidgets as widgets
    
    model_ids = ["black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell", "black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev"]
    
    model_selector = widgets.Dropdown(
        options=model_ids,
        default=model_ids[0],
        description="Model:",
    )
    
    
    model_selector




.. parsed-literal::

    Dropdown(description='Model:', options=('black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell', 'black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev'), vâ€¦



   **Note**: run Flux.1-dev model with notebook, you will need to accept
   license agreement. You must be a registered user in Hugging Face
   Hub. Please visit `HuggingFace model
   card <https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev>`__,
   carefully read terms of usage and click accept button. You will need
   to use an access token for the code below to run. For more
   information on access tokens, refer to `this section of the
   documentation <https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens>`__.
   You can login on Hugging Face Hub in notebook environment, using
   following code:

.. code:: ipython3

    # uncomment these lines to login to huggingfacehub to get access to pretrained model
    
    # from huggingface_hub import notebook_login, whoami
    
    # try:
    #     whoami()
    #     print('Authorization token already provided')
    # except OSError:
    #     notebook_login()

Convert model with OpenVINO
---------------------------



Starting from 2023.0 release, OpenVINO supports PyTorch models directly
via Model Conversion API. ``ov.convert_model`` function accepts instance
of PyTorch model and example inputs for tracing and returns object of
``ov.Model`` class, ready to use or save on disk using ``ov.save_model``
function.

The pipeline consists of four important parts:

-  Clip and T5 Text Encoders to create condition to generate an image
   from a text prompt.
-  Transformer for step-by-step denoising latent image representation.
-  Autoencoder (VAE) for decoding latent space to image.

Convert model using Optimum Intel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



For convenience, we will use OpenVINO integration with HuggingFace
Optimum. `Optimum
Intel <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/index>`__ is the
interface between the Transformers and Diffusers libraries and the
different tools and libraries provided by Intel to accelerate end-to-end
pipelines on Intel architectures.

Among other use cases, Optimum Intel provides a simple interface to
optimize your Transformers and Diffusers models, convert them to the
OpenVINO Intermediate Representation (IR) format and run inference using
OpenVINO Runtime. ``optimum-cli`` provides command line interface for
model conversion and optimization.

General command format:

.. code:: bash

   optimum-cli export openvino --model <model_id_or_path> --task <task> <output_dir>

where task is task to export the model for, if not specified, the task
will be auto-inferred based on the model. You can find a mapping between
tasks and model classes in Optimum TaskManager
`documentation <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/exporters/task_manager>`__.
Additionally, you can specify weights compression using
``--weight-format`` argument with one of following options: ``fp32``,
``fp16``, ``int8`` and ``int4``. Fro int8 and int4
`nncf <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf>`__ will be used for
weight compression. More details about model export provided in `Optimum
Intel
documentation <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/openvino/export#export-your-model>`__.

Compress model weights
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



For reducing model memory consumption we will use weights compression.
The `Weights
Compression <https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/openvino-workflow/model-optimization-guide/weight-compression.html>`__
algorithm is aimed at compressing the weights of the models and can be
used to optimize the model footprint and performance of large models
where the size of weights is relatively larger than the size of
activations, for example, Large Language Models (LLM). Compared to INT8
compression, INT4 compression improves performance even more, but
introduces a minor drop in prediction quality. We will use
`NNCF <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf>`__ integration to
``optimum-cli`` tool for weight compression.

.. code:: ipython3

    to_compress = widgets.Checkbox(
        value=True,
        description="Weight compression",
        disabled=False,
    )
    
    to_compress




.. parsed-literal::

    Checkbox(value=True, description='Weight compression')



.. code:: ipython3

    from pathlib import Path
    
    model_id = model_selector.value
    
    model_base_dir = Path(model_id.split("/")[-1])
    additional_args = {}
    
    if to_compress.value:
        model_dir = model_base_dir / "INT4"
        additional_args.update({"weight-format": "int4", "group-size": "64", "ratio": "1.0"})
    else:
        model_dir = model_base_dir / "FP16"
        additional_args.update({"weight-format": "fp16"})

.. code:: ipython3

    from cmd_helper import optimum_cli
    
    if not model_dir.exists():
        optimum_cli(model_id, model_dir, additional_args=additional_args)

Run OpenVINO model inference
----------------------------



``OVDiffusionPipeline`` from Optimum Intel provides ready-to-use
interface for running Diffusers models using OpenVINO. It supports
various models including Stable Diffusion, Stable Diffusion XL, LCM,
Stable Diffusion v3 and Flux. Similar to original Diffusers pipeline,
for initialization, we should use ``from_preptrained`` method providing
model id from HuggingFace hub or local directory (both original PyTorch
and OpenVINO models formats supported, in the first case model class
additionally will trigger model conversion).

.. code:: ipython3

    from notebook_utils import device_widget
    
    device = device_widget(default="CPU", exclude=["NPU"])
    device




.. parsed-literal::

    Dropdown(description='Device:', options=('CPU', 'AUTO'), value='CPU')



.. code:: ipython3

    import ipywidgets as widgets
    
    model_available = (model_base_dir / "INT4").is_dir()
    use_quantized_models = widgets.Checkbox(
        value=model_available,
        description="Use compressed models",
        disabled=not model_available,
    )
    
    use_quantized_models

    Checkbox(value=True, description='Use compressed models')



.. code:: ipython3

    from optimum.intel.openvino import OVDiffusionPipeline
    
    model_dir = model_base_dir / "INT4" if use_quantized_models.value else model_base_dir / "FP16"
    
    ov_pipe = OVDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_dir, device=device.value)
