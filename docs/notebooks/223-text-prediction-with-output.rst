Text Prediction with OpenVINO™
==============================

This notebook shows text prediction with OpenVINO. This notebook can
work in two different modes, Text Generation and Conversation, which the
user can select via selecting the model in the Model Selection Section.
We use three models
`GPT-2 <https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf>`__,
`GPT-Neo <https://zenodo.org/record/5297715#.ZAmpsXZBztU>`__, and
`PersonaGPT <https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12949v1>`__, which are a part of
the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) family. GPT-2 and GPT-Neo
can be used for text generation, whereas PersonaGPT is trained for the
downstream task of conversation.

GPT-2 and GPT-Neo are pre-trained on a large corpus of English text
using unsupervised training. They both display a broad set of
capabilities, including the ability to generate conditional synthetic
text samples of unprecedented quality, where we prime the model with an
input and have it generate a lengthy continuation.

More details about the models are provided on their HuggingFace cards:

-  `GPT-2 <https://huggingface.co/gpt2>`__
-  `GPT-Neo <https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M>`__

PersonaGPT is an open-domain conversational agent that can decode
*personalized* and *controlled* responses based on user input. It is
built on the pretrained
`DialoGPT-medium <https://github.com/microsoft/DialoGPT>`__ model,
following the `GPT-2 <https://github.com/openai/gpt-2>`__ architecture.
PersonaGPT is fine-tuned on the
`Persona-Chat <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07243>`__ dataset. The model
is available from
`HuggingFace <https://huggingface.co/af1tang/personaGPT>`__. PersonaGPT
displays a broad set of capabilities, including the ability to take on
personas, where we prime the model with few facts and have it generate
based upon that, it can also be used for creating a chatbot on a
knowledge base.

The following image illustrates the complete demo pipeline used for text
generation:

This is a demonstration in which the user can type the beginning of the
text and the network will generate a further. This procedure can be
repeated as many times as the user desires.

For Text Generation, The model input is tokenized text, which serves as
the initial condition for text generation. Then, logits from the models’
inference results are obtained, and the token with the highest
probability is selected using the top-k sampling strategy and joined to
the input sequence. This procedure repeats until the end of the sequence
token is received or the specified maximum length is reached. After
that, tokenized IDs are decoded to text.

The following image illustrates the demo pipeline for conversation:

.. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95569637/226101538-e204aebd-a34f-4c8b-b90c-5363ba41c080.jpeg
   :alt: image2

For Conversation, User Input is tokenized with ``eos_token``
concatenated in the end. Then, the text gets generated as detailed
above. The Generated response is added to the history with the
``eos_token`` at the end. Additional user input is added to the history,
and the sequence is passed back into the model.

    if model_name.value == "PersonaGPT (Converastional)":
        pt_model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('af1tang/personaGPT')

Convert Pytorch Model to OpenVINO IR
------------------------------------



For starting work with GPT-Neo model using OpenVINO, a model should be
converted to OpenVINO Intermediate Representation (IR) format.
HuggingFace provides a GPT-Neo model in PyTorch format, which is
supported in OpenVINO via Model Conversion API. The ``ov.convert_model``
Python function of `model conversion
API <https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.3/openvino_docs_model_processing_introduction.html>`__
can be used for converting the model. The function returns instance of
OpenVINO Model class, which is ready to use in Python interface. The
Model can also be save on device in OpenVINO IR format for future
execution using ``ov.save_model``. In our case dynamic input shapes with
a possible shape range (from 1 token to a maximum length defined in our
processing function) are specified for optimization of memory
consumption.

.. code:: ipython3

    from pathlib import Path
    import torch

    import openvino as ov

    # define path for saving openvino model
    model_path = Path("model/text_generator.xml")

    example_input = {"input_ids": torch.ones((1, 10), dtype=torch.long), "attention_mask": torch.ones((1, 10), dtype=torch.long)}
    pt_model.config.torchscript = True

    # convert model to openvino
    if model_name.value == "PersonaGPT (Converastional)":
        ov_model = ov.convert_model(pt_model, example_input=example_input, input=[('input_ids', [1, -1], ov.Type.i64), ('attention_mask', [1,-1], ov.Type.i64)])
    else:
        ov_model = ov.convert_model(pt_model, example_input=example_input, input=[('input_ids', [1, ov.Dimension(1,128)], ov.Type.i64), ('attention_mask', [1, ov.Dimension(1,128)], ov.Type.i64)])

    # serialize openvino model
    ov.save_model(ov_model, str(model_path))

Load the model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



We start by building an OpenVINO Core object. Then we read the network
architecture and model weights from the ``.xml`` and ``.bin`` files,
respectively. Finally, we compile the model for the desired device.

Select inference device
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



select device from dropdown list for running inference using OpenVINO

.. code:: ipython3

    import ipywidgets as widgets

    # initialize openvino core
    core = ov.Core()

    device = widgets.Dropdown(
        options=core.available_devices + ["AUTO"],
        value='AUTO',
        description='Device:',
        disabled=False,
    )

    device




.. parsed-literal::

    Dropdown(description='Device:', index=1, options=('CPU', 'AUTO'), value='AUTO')



.. code:: ipython3

    # read the model and corresponding weights from file
    model = core.read_model(model_path)

.. code:: ipython3

    # compile the model for CPU devices
    compiled_model = core.compile_model(model=model, device_name=device.value)

    # get output tensors
    output_key = compiled_model.output(0)

Input keys are the names of the input nodes and output keys contain
names of the output nodes of the network. In the case of GPT-Neo, we
have ``batch size`` and ``sequence length`` as inputs and
``batch size``, ``sequence length`` and ``vocab size`` as outputs.

Pre-Processing
--------------



NLP models often take a list of tokens as a standard input. A token is a
word or a part of a word mapped to an integer. To provide the proper
input, we use a vocabulary file to handle the mapping. So first let’s
load the vocabulary file.

Define tokenization
-------------------



.. code:: ipython3

    from typing import List, Tuple


    # this function converts text to tokens
    def tokenize(text: str) -> Tuple[List[int], List[int]]:
        """
        tokenize input text using GPT2 tokenizer

        Parameters:
          text, str - input text
        Returns:
          input_ids - np.array with input token ids
          attention_mask - np.array with 0 in place, where should be padding and 1 for places where original tokens are located, represents attention mask for model
        """

        inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="np")
        return inputs["input_ids"], inputs["attention_mask"]

``eos_token`` is special token, which means that generation is finished.
We store the index of this token in order to use this index as padding
at later stage.

.. code:: ipython3

    eos_token_id = tokenizer.eos_token_id
    eos_token = tokenizer.decode(eos_token_id)

Define Softmax layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A softmax function is used to
convert top-k logits into a probability distribution.

.. code:: ipython3

    import numpy as np


    def softmax(x : np.array) -> np.array:
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x, axis=-1, keepdims=True))
        summation = e_x.sum(axis=-1, keepdims=True)
        return e_x / summation

Set the minimum sequence length
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



If the minimum sequence length is not reached, the following code will
reduce the probability of the ``eos`` token occurring. This continues
the process of generating the next words.

.. code:: ipython3

    def process_logits(cur_length: int, scores: np.array, eos_token_id : int, min_length : int = 0) -> np.array:
        """
        Reduce probability for padded indices.

        Parameters:
          cur_length: Current length of input sequence.
          scores: Model output logits.
          eos_token_id: Index of end of string token in model vocab.
          min_length: Minimum length for applying postprocessing.

        Returns:
          Processed logits with reduced probability for padded indices.
        """
        if cur_length < min_length:
            scores[:, eos_token_id] = -float("inf")
        return scores

Top-K sampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



In Top-K sampling, we filter the K most likely next words and
redistribute the probability mass among only those K next words.

.. code:: ipython3

    def get_top_k_logits(scores : np.array, top_k : int) -> np.array:
        """
        Perform top-k sampling on the logits scores.

        Parameters:
          scores: np.array, model output logits.
          top_k: int, number of elements with the highest probability to select.

        Returns:
          np.array, shape (batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size),
            filtered logits scores where only the top-k elements with the highest
            probability are kept and the rest are replaced with -inf
        """
        filter_value = -float("inf")
        top_k = min(max(top_k, 1), scores.shape[-1])
        top_k_scores = -np.sort(-scores)[:, :top_k]
        indices_to_remove = scores < np.min(top_k_scores)
        filtred_scores = np.ma.array(scores, mask=indices_to_remove,
                                     fill_value=filter_value).filled()
        return filtred_scores

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            # break the loop if max length or end of text token is reached
            if cur_input_len == max_sequence_length or next_tokens[0] == eos_token_id:

The ``text`` variable below is the input used to generate a predicted
sequence.

.. parsed-literal::

    Selected Model is PersonaGPT. Please select GPT-Neo or GPT-2 in the first cell to generate text sequences


Conversation with PersonaGPT using OpenVINO
===========================================



User Input is tokenized with ``eos_token`` concatenated in the end.
Model input is tokenized text, which serves as initial condition for
generation, then logits from model inference result should be obtained
and token with the highest probability is selected using top-k sampling
strategy and joined to input sequence. The procedure repeats until end
of sequence token will be received or specified maximum length is
reached. After that, decoding token ids to text using tokenized should
be applied.

The Generated response is added to the history with the ``eos_token`` at
the end. Further User Input is added to it and again passed into the
model.
