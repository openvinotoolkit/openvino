Visual-language assistant with InternVL2 and OpenVINO
=====================================================

InternVL 2.0 is the latest addition to the InternVL series of multimodal
large language models. InternVL 2.0 features a variety of
instruction-tuned models, ranging from 1 billion to 108 billion
parameters. Compared to the state-of-the-art open-source multimodal
large language models, InternVL 2.0 surpasses most open-source models.
It demonstrates competitive performance on par with proprietary
commercial models across various capabilities, including document and
chart comprehension, infographics QA, scene text understanding and OCR
tasks, scientific and mathematical problem solving, as well as cultural
understanding and integrated multimodal capabilities.

More details about model can be found in `model
card <https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternVL2-4B>`__,
`blog <https://internvl.github.io/blog/2024-07-02-InternVL-2.0/>`__ and
original `repo <https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVL>`__.

In this tutorial we consider how to convert and optimize InternVL2 model
for creating multimodal chatbot. Additionally, we demonstrate how to
apply stateful transformation on LLM part and model optimization
techniques like weights compression using
`NNCF <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf>`__

There are multiple InternVL2 models available in `models

You can select one of them for conversion and optimization in notebook

Convert and Optimize model
--------------------------



InternVL2 is PyTorch model. OpenVINO supports PyTorch models via
conversion to OpenVINO Intermediate Representation (IR). `OpenVINO model
conversion
API <https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/openvino-workflow/model-preparation.html#convert-a-model-with-python-convert-model>`__
should be used for these purposes. ``ov.convert_model`` function accepts
original PyTorch model instance and example input for tracing and
returns ``ov.Model`` representing this model in OpenVINO framework.
Converted model can be used for saving on disk using ``ov.save_model``
function or directly loading on device using ``core.complie_model``.
``internvl2_helper.py`` script contains helper function for model
conversion, please check its content if you interested in conversion
details.

   <details>

Click here for more detailed explanation of conversion steps InternVL2
is autoregressive transformer generative model, it means that each next
model step depends from model output from previous step. The generation
approach is based on the assumption that the probability distribution of
a word sequence can be decomposed into the product of conditional next
word distributions. In other words, model predicts the next token in the
loop guided by previously generated tokens until the stop-condition will
be not reached (generated sequence of maximum length or end of string
token obtained). The way the next token will be selected over predicted
probabilities is driven by the selected decoding methodology. You can
find more information about the most popular decoding methods in this
blog. The entry point for the generation process for models from the
Hugging Face Transformers library is the ``generate`` method. You can
find more information about its parameters and configuration in the
documentation. To preserve flexibility in the selection decoding
methodology, we will convert only model inference for one step.

The inference flow has difference on first step and for the next. On the
first step, model accept preprocessed input instruction and image, that
transformed to the unified embedding space using ``input_embedding`` and
``image_encoder`` models, after that ``language model``, LLM-based part
of model, runs on input embeddings to predict probability of next
generated tokens. On the next step, ``language_model`` accepts only next
token id selected based on sampling strategy and processed by
``input_embedding`` model and cached attention key and values. Since the
output side is auto-regressive, an output token hidden state remains the
same once computed for every further generation step. Therefore,
recomputing it every time you want to generate a new token seems
wasteful. With the cache, the model saves the hidden state once it has
been computed. The model only computes the one for the most recently
generated output token at each time step, re-using the saved ones for
hidden tokens. This reduces the generation complexity from
:math:`O(n^3)` to :math:`O(n^2)` for a transformer model. More details
about how it works can be found in this
`article <https://scale.com/blog/pytorch-improvements#Text%20Translation>`__.
To sum up above, model consists of 4 parts:

-  **Image encoder** for encoding input images into embedding space.
-  **Input Embedding** for conversion input text tokens into embedding
   space
-  **Language Model** for generation answer based on input embeddings
   provided by Image Encoder and Input Embedding models.

Compress model weights to 4-bit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For reducing memory
consumption, weights compression optimization can be applied using
`NNCF <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf>`__.

.. raw:: html

   <details>

Click here for more details about weight compression Weight compression
aims to reduce the memory footprint of a model. It can also lead to
significant performance improvement for large memory-bound models, such
as Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs and other models, which require
extensive memory to store the weights during inference, can benefit from
weight compression in the following ways:

-  enabling the inference of exceptionally large models that cannot be
   accommodated in the memory of the device;

-  improving the inference performance of the models by reducing the
   latency of the memory access when computing the operations with
   weights, for example, Linear layers.

`Neural Network Compression Framework
(NNCF) <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf>`__ provides 4-bit /
8-bit mixed weight quantization as a compression method primarily
designed to optimize LLMs. The main difference between weights
compression and full model quantization (post-training quantization) is
that activations remain floating-point in the case of weights
compression which leads to a better accuracy. Weight compression for
LLMs provides a solid inference performance improvement which is on par
with the performance of the full model quantization. In addition, weight
compression is data-free and does not require a calibration dataset,
making it easy to use.

``nncf.compress_weights`` function can be used for performing weights
compression. The function accepts an OpenVINO model and other
compression parameters. Compared to INT8 compression, INT4 compression
improves performance even more, but introduces a minor drop in
prediction quality.

More details about weights compression, can be found in `OpenVINO
documentation <https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/openvino-workflow/model-optimization-guide/weight-compression.html>`__.

Prepare model inference pipeline
--------------------------------



As discussed, the model comprises Image Encoder and LLM (with separated
text embedding part) that generates answer. In ``internvl2_helper.py``
we defined LLM inference class ``OvModelForCausalLMWithEmb`` that will
represent generation cycle, It is based on `HuggingFace Transformers
GenerationMixin <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/text_generation>`__
and looks similar to `Optimum
Intel <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/index>`__
``OVModelForCausalLM`` that is used for LLM inference with only
difference that it can accept input embedding. In own turn, general
multimodal model class ``OVInternVLChatModel`` handles chatbot
functionality including image processing and answer generation using
LLM.

.. code:: ipython3

    from internvl2_helper import OVInternVLChatModel
    from transformers import AutoTokenizer
    
    # Uncomment below lines to see the model inference class code
    
    # OVInternVLChatModel??
