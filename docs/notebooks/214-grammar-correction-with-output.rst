Grammatical Error Correction with OpenVINO
==========================================

AI-based auto-correction products are becoming increasingly popular due
to their ease of use, editing speed, and affordability. These products
improve the quality of written text in emails, blogs, and chats.

Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) is the task of correcting different
types of errors in text such as spelling, punctuation, grammatical and
word choice errors. GEC is typically formulated as a sentence correction
task. A GEC system takes a potentially erroneous sentence as input and
is expected to transform it into a more correct version. See the example
given below:

=========================== ==========================
Input (Erroneous)           Output (Corrected)
=========================== ==========================
I like to rides my bicycle. I like to ride my bicycle.
=========================== ==========================

As shown in the image below, different types of errors in written
language can be corrected.

This tutorial shows how to perform grammatical error correction using
OpenVINO. We will use pre-trained models from the `Hugging Face
Transformers <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index>`__
library. To simplify the user experience, the `Hugging Face
Optimum <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum>`__ library is used to
convert the models to OpenVINOâ„¢ IR format.

It consists of the following steps:

-  Install prerequisites
-  Download and convert models from a public source using the `OpenVINO
   integration with Hugging Face
   Optimum <https://huggingface.co/blog/openvino>`__.
-  Create an inference pipeline for grammatical error checking
-  Optimize grammar correction pipeline with
   `NNCF <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/>`__ quantization
-  Compare original and optimized pipelines from performance and
   accuracy standpoints

How does it work?
-----------------



A Grammatical Error Correction task can be thought of as a
sequence-to-sequence task where a model is trained to take a
grammatically incorrect sentence as input and return a grammatically
correct sentence as output. We will use the
`FLAN-T5 <https://huggingface.co/pszemraj/flan-t5-large-grammar-synthesis>`__
model finetuned on an expanded version of the
`JFLEG <https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/jfleg>`__ dataset.

The version of FLAN-T5 released with the `Scaling Instruction-Finetuned
Language Models <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf>`__ paper is an
enhanced version of `T5 <https://huggingface.co/t5-large>`__ that has
been finetuned on a combination of tasks. The paper explores instruction
finetuning with a particular focus on scaling the number of tasks,
scaling the model size, and finetuning on chain-of-thought data. The
paper discovers that overall instruction finetuning is a general method
that improves the performance and usability of pre-trained language
models.

For more details about the model, please check out
`paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416>`__, original
`repository <https://github.com/google-research/t5x>`__, and Hugging
Face `model card <https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-large>`__

Additionally, to reduce the number of sentences required to be
processed, you can perform grammatical correctness checking. This task
should be considered as a simple binary text classification, where the
model gets input text and predicts label 1 if a text contains any
grammatical errors and 0 if it does not. You will use the
`roberta-base-CoLA <https://huggingface.co/textattack/roberta-base-CoLA>`__
model, the RoBERTa Base model finetuned on the CoLA dataset. The RoBERTa
model was proposed in `RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining
Approach paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692>`__. It builds on BERT
and modifies key hyperparameters, removing the next-sentence
pre-training objective and training with much larger mini-batches and
learning rates. Additional details about the model can be found in a
`blog
post <https://ai.facebook.com/blog/roberta-an-optimized-method-for-pretraining-self-supervised-nlp-systems/>`__
by Meta AI and in the `Hugging Face
documentation <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/roberta>`__

Now that we know more about FLAN-T5 and RoBERTa, let us get started. ðŸš€

Prerequisites
-------------



First, we need to install the `Hugging Face
Optimum <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index>`__ library
accelerated by OpenVINO integration. The Hugging Face Optimum API is a
high-level API that enables us to convert and quantize models from the
Hugging Face Transformers library to the OpenVINOâ„¢ IR format. For more
details, refer to the `Hugging Face Optimum
documentation <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/inference>`__.

.. code:: ipython3

    %pip install -q "git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel.git" "openvino>=2023.1.0" onnx gradio "transformers>=4.33.0" --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
    %pip install -q "nncf>=2.7.0" datasets jiwer

Download and Convert Models
---------------------------



Optimum Intel can be used to load optimized models from the `Hugging
Face Hub <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/hf.co/models>`__ and
create pipelines to run an inference with OpenVINO Runtime using Hugging
Face APIs. The Optimum Inference models are API compatible with Hugging
Face Transformers models. This means we just need to replace
``AutoModelForXxx`` class with the corresponding ``OVModelForXxx``
class.

Below is an example of the RoBERTa text classification model

.. code:: diff

   -from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification
   +from optimum.intel.openvino import OVModelForSequenceClassification
   from transformers import AutoTokenizer, pipeline

   model_id = "textattack/roberta-base-CoLA"
   -model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_id)
   +model = OVModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_id, from_transformers=True)

Model class initialization starts with calling ``from_pretrained``
method. When downloading and converting Transformers model, the
parameter ``from_transformers=True`` should be added. We can save the
converted model for the next usage with the ``save_pretrained`` method.
Tokenizer class and pipelines API are compatible with Optimum models.

Let us check model work, using inference pipeline for

Hugging Face inference pipelines in this
`tutorial <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/pipeline_tutorial>`__

.. code:: ipython3

    input_text = "They are moved by salar energy"
    grammar_checker_pipe = pipeline("text-classification", model=grammar_checker_model, tokenizer=grammar_checker_tokenizer)
    result = grammar_checker_pipe(input_text)[0]
    print(f"input text: {input_text}")
    print(f'predicted label: {"contains_errors" if result["label"] == "LABEL_1" else "no errors"}')
    print(f'predicted score: {result["score"] :.2}')


.. parsed-literal::

Great! Looks like the model can detect errors in the sample.

Grammar Corrector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



The steps for loading the Grammar Corrector model are very similar,
except for the model class that is used. Because FLAN-T5 is a
sequence-to-sequence text generation model, we should use the
``OVModelForSeq2SeqLM`` class and the ``text2text-generation`` pipeline
to run it.

.. code:: ipython3

    grammar_corrector_model_id = "pszemraj/flan-t5-large-grammar-synthesis"
    grammar_corrector_dir = Path("flan-t5-large-grammar-synthesis")
    grammar_corrector_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(grammar_corrector_model_id)

    if grammar_corrector_dir.exists():

    else:

Prepare Demo Pipeline
---------------------



Now let us put everything together and create the pipeline for grammar
correction. The pipeline accepts input text, verifies its correctness,
and generates the correct version if required. It will consist of
several steps:

1. Split text on sentences.
2. Check grammatical correctness for each sentence using Grammar
   Checker.
3. Generate an improved version of the sentence if required.

        for sentence in sentences:

Quantization
------------



`NNCF <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/>`__ enables
post-training quantization by adding quantization layers into model
graph and then using a subset of the training dataset to initialize the
parameters of these additional quantization layers. Quantized operations
are executed in ``INT8`` instead of ``FP32``/``FP16`` making model
inference faster.

Grammar checker model takes up a tiny portion of the whole text
correction pipeline so we optimize only the grammar corrector model.
Grammar corrector itself consists of three models: encoder, first call
decoder and decoder with past. The last modelâ€™s share of inference
dominates the other ones. Because of this we quantize only it.

The optimization process contains the following steps:

1. Create a calibration dataset for quantization.
2. Run ``nncf.quantize()`` to obtain quantized models.
3. Serialize the ``INT8`` model using ``openvino.save_model()``
   function.

Please select below whether you would like to run quantization to
improve model inference speed.

.. code:: ipython3

    to_quantize = widgets.Checkbox(

Compare model size, performance and accuracy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



First, we compare file size of ``FP32`` and ``INT8`` models.

.. code:: ipython3

    from utils import calculate_compression_rate

    if to_quantize.value:
        model_size_fp32, model_size_int8 = calculate_compression_rate(grammar_corrector_dir / "openvino_decoder_with_past_model.xml", quantized_model_path)


.. parsed-literal::

    Model footprint comparison:
        * FP32 IR model size: 1658150.26 KB
        * INT8 IR model size: 415713.38 KB

Second, we compare two grammar correction pipelines from performance and
accuracy stand points.

Test split of \ `jfleg <https://huggingface.co/datasets/jfleg>`__\
dataset is used for testing. One dataset sample consists of a text with
errors as input and several corrected versions as labels. When measuring
accuracy we use mean ``(1 - WER)`` against corrected text versions,
where WER is Word Error Rate metric.

.. code:: ipython3

    from utils import calculate_inference_time_and_accuracy

    TEST_SUBSET_SIZE = 50

    if to_quantize.value:
        inference_time_fp32, accuracy_fp32 = calculate_inference_time_and_accuracy(grammar_corrector_pipe_fp32, TEST_SUBSET_SIZE)
        print(f"Evaluation results of FP32 grammar correction pipeline. Accuracy: {accuracy_fp32:.2f}%. Time: {inference_time_fp32:.2f} sec.")
        inference_time_int8, accuracy_int8 = calculate_inference_time_and_accuracy(grammar_corrector_pipe_int8, TEST_SUBSET_SIZE)
        print(f"Evaluation results of INT8 grammar correction pipeline. Accuracy: {accuracy_int8:.2f}%. Time: {inference_time_int8:.2f} sec.")
        print(f"Performance speedup: {inference_time_fp32 / inference_time_int8:.3f}")
        print(f"Accuracy drop :{accuracy_fp32 - accuracy_int8:.2f}%.")
        print(f"Model footprint reduction: {model_size_fp32 / model_size_int8:.3f}")
