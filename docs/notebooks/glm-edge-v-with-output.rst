Visual-language assistant with GLM-Edge-V and OpenVINO
------------------------------------------------------

The
`GLM-Edge <https://huggingface.co/collections/THUDM/glm-edge-6743283c5809de4a7b9e0b8b>`__
series is `Zhipu <https://huggingface.co/THUDM>`__\ ’s attempt to meet
real-world deployment scenarios for edge devices. It consists of two
sizes of large language dialogue models and multimodal understanding
models (GLM-Edge-1.5B-Chat, GLM-Edge-4B-Chat, GLM-Edge-V-2B,
GLM-Edge-V-5B). Among them, the 1.5B / 2B models are mainly targeted at
platforms like mobile phones and car machines, while the 4B / 5B models
are aimed at platforms like PCs. Based on the technological advancements
of the GLM-4 series, some targeted adjustments have been made to the
model structure and size, balancing model performance, real-world
inference efficiency, and deployment convenience. Through deep
collaboration with partner enterprises and relentless efforts in
inference optimization, the GLM-Edge series models can run at extremely
high speeds on some edge platforms.

In this tutorial we consider how to launch multimodal model GLM-Edge-V
using OpenVINO for creation multimodal chatbot. Additionally, we
optimize model to low precision using
`NNCF <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf>`__

Convert and Optimize model
--------------------------



GLM-Edge-V is PyTorch model. OpenVINO supports PyTorch models via
conversion to OpenVINO Intermediate Representation (IR). `OpenVINO model
conversion
API <https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/openvino-workflow/model-preparation.html#convert-a-model-with-python-convert-model>`__
should be used for these purposes. ``ov.convert_model`` function accepts
original PyTorch model instance and example input for tracing and
returns ``ov.Model`` representing this model in OpenVINO framework.
Converted model can be used for saving on disk using ``ov.save_model``
function or directly loading on device using ``core.complie_model``.

The script ``glmv_helper.py`` contains helper function for model
conversion, please check its content if you interested in conversion
details.

   <details>

Click here for more detailed explanation of conversion steps GLM-Edge-V
is autoregressive transformer generative model, it means that each next
model step depends from model output from previous step. The generation
approach is based on the assumption that the probability distribution of
a word sequence can be decomposed into the product of conditional next
word distributions. In other words, model predicts the next token in the
loop guided by previously generated tokens until the stop-condition will
be not reached (generated sequence of maximum length or end of string
token obtained). The way the next token will be selected over predicted
probabilities is driven by the selected decoding methodology. You can
find more information about the most popular decoding methods in this
blog. The entry point for the generation process for models from the
Hugging Face Transformers library is the ``generate`` method. You can
find more information about its parameters and configuration in the
documentation. To preserve flexibility in the selection decoding
methodology, we will convert only model inference for one step.

GLM-Edge-V model consists of 3 parts:

-  **Vision Model** for encoding input images into embedding space.
-  **Embedding Model** for conversion input text tokens into embedding
   space
-  **Language Model** for generation answer based on input embeddings
   provided by Image Encoder and Input Embedding models.

Compress model weights to 4-bit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For reducing memory
consumption, weights compression optimization can be applied using
`NNCF <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf>`__.

.. raw:: html

   <details>

Click here for more details about weight compression Weight compression
aims to reduce the memory footprint of a model. It can also lead to
significant performance improvement for large memory-bound models, such
as Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs and other models, which require
extensive memory to store the weights during inference, can benefit from
weight compression in the following ways:

-  enabling the inference of exceptionally large models that cannot be
   accommodated in the memory of the device;

-  improving the inference performance of the models by reducing the
   latency of the memory access when computing the operations with
   weights, for example, Linear layers.

`Neural Network Compression Framework
(NNCF) <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf>`__ provides 4-bit /
8-bit mixed weight quantization as a compression method primarily
designed to optimize LLMs. The main difference between weights
compression and full model quantization (post-training quantization) is
that activations remain floating-point in the case of weights
compression which leads to a better accuracy. Weight compression for
LLMs provides a solid inference performance improvement which is on par
with the performance of the full model quantization. In addition, weight
compression is data-free and does not require a calibration dataset,
making it easy to use.

``nncf.compress_weights`` function can be used for performing weights
compression. The function accepts an OpenVINO model and other
compression parameters. Compared to INT8 compression, INT4 compression
improves performance even more, but introduces a minor drop in
prediction quality.

More details about weights compression, can be found in `OpenVINO
documentation <https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/openvino-workflow/model-optimization-guide/weight-compression.html>`__.
