Florence-2: Open Source Vision Foundation Model
===============================================

Florence-2 is a lightweight vision-language foundation model developed
by Microsoft Azure AI and open-sourced under the MIT license. It aims to
achieve a unified, prompt-based representation for diverse vision and
vision-language tasks, including captioning, object detection,
grounding, and segmentation. Despite its compact size, Florence-2 rivals
much larger models like
`Kosmos-2 <kosmos2-multimodal-large-language-model-with-output.html>`__
in performance. Florence-2 represents a significant advancement in
vision-language models by combining lightweight architecture with robust
capabilities, making it highly accessible and versatile. Its unified
representation approach, supported by the extensive FLD-5B dataset,
enables it to excel in multiple vision tasks without the need for
separate models. This efficiency makes Florence-2 a strong contender for
real-world applications, particularly on devices with limited resources.

More details about model can be found in `modelâ€™s resources
collection <https://huggingface.co/collections/microsoft/florence-6669f44df0d87d9c3bfb76de>`__
and original `paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06242>`__

In this tutorial we consider how to convert and run Florence2 using
OpenVINO.

Installation Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a self-contained example that relies solely on its own code.

We recommend running the notebook in a virtual environment. You only
need a Jupyter server to start. For details, please refer to
`Installation
Guide <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/blob/latest/README.md#-installation-guide>`__.

The Florence-2 series consists of two models: Florence-2-base and
Florence-2-large, with 0.23 billion and 0.77 billion parameters,
respectively. Additionally, authors provide finetuned on collection of
downstream tasks model versions. In this tutorial you can select one of
available model. By default, we will use
`Florence-2-base-ft <https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Florence-2-base-ft>`__.

Convert model
-------------



Florence2 is PyTorch model. OpenVINO supports PyTorch models via
conversion to OpenVINO Intermediate Representation (IR). `OpenVINO model
conversion
API <https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/openvino-workflow/model-preparation.html#convert-a-model-with-python-convert-model>`__
should be used for these purposes. ``ov.convert_model`` function accepts
original PyTorch model instance and example input for tracing and
returns ``ov.Model`` representing this model in OpenVINO framework.
Converted model can be used for saving on disk using ``ov.save_model``
function or directly loading on device using ``core.complie_model``.
``ov_florence2_helper.py`` script contains helper function for model
conversion, please check its content if you interested in conversion
details.

.. raw:: html

   <details>

Click here for more detailed explanation of conversion steps The model
takes images and task prompts as input, generating the desired results
in text format. It uses a DaViT vision encoder to convert images into
visual token embeddings. These are then concatenated with BERT-generated
text embeddings and processed by a transformer-based multi-modal
encoder-decoder to generate the response.

|image0|

To sum up above, model consists of 4 parts:

-  **Image Encoder** for transforming input images into flattened visual
   token embeddings.
-  **Input Embedding** for conversion input text tokens or task
   description into embedding space.
-  **Encoder** and **Decoder** for generation answer based on input
   embeddings provided by Image Encoder and Input Embedding models. The
   model employs a seq2seq framework, seamlessly integrating the image
   encoder with a multi-modality encoder-decoder.

We will convert each part separately, then combine them in inference
pipeline.

From ðŸ‘‰v4.50ðŸ‘ˆ onwards, `PreTrainedModel` will NOT inherit from `GenerationMixin`, and this model will lose the ability to call `generate` and other related functions.
      - If you're using `trust_remote_code=True`, you can get rid of this warning by loading the model with an auto class. See https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/auto#auto-classes

Run model inference
-------------------



``OvFlorence2Model`` class defined in ``ov_florence2_helper.py``
provides convenient way for running model. It accepts directory with
converted model and inference device as arguments. For running model we
will use ``generate`` method.

.. code:: ipython3

    from ov_florence2_helper import OVFlorence2Model
    
    # Uncomment the line to see model class code
    # ??OVFlorence2Model

.. code:: ipython3

    model = OVFlorence2Model(model_path, device.value)

Additionally, for model usage we also need ``Processor`` class, that
distributed with original model and can be loaded using
``AutoProcessor`` from ``transformers`` library. Processor is
responsible for input data preparation and decoding model output.

.. code:: ipython3

    import requests
    from PIL import Image
    
    from transformers import AutoProcessor
    
    processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_path, trust_remote_code=True)
    
    prompt = "<OD>"
    
    url = "https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/tasks/car.jpg?download=true"
    image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

Letâ€™s check model capabilities in Object Detection.

.. code:: ipython3

    inputs = processor(text=prompt, images=image, return_tensors="pt")
    
    generated_ids = model.generate(input_ids=inputs["input_ids"], pixel_values=inputs["pixel_values"], max_new_tokens=1024, do_sample=False, num_beams=3)
    generated_text = processor.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=False)[0]
    
    parsed_answer = processor.post_process_generation(generated_text, task="<OD>", image_size=(image.width, image.height))

    fig = plot_bbox(image, parsed_answer["<OD>"])
