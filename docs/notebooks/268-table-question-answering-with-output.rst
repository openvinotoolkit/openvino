Table Question Answering using TAPAS and OpenVINO™
==================================================

Table Question Answering (Table QA) is the answering a question about an
information on a given table. You can use the Table Question Answering
models to simulate SQL execution by inputting a table.

In this tutorial we demonstrate how to perform table question answering
using OpenVINO. This example based on `TAPAS base model fine-tuned on
WikiTable Questions
(WTQ) <https://huggingface.co/google/tapas-base-finetuned-wtq>`__ that
is based on the paper `TAPAS: Weakly Supervised Table Parsing via
Pre-training <https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02349#:~:text=Answering%20natural%20language%20questions%20over,denotations%20instead%20of%20logical%20forms>`__.

Answering natural language questions over tables is usually seen as a
semantic parsing task. To alleviate the collection cost of full logical
forms, one popular approach focuses on weak supervision consisting of
denotations instead of logical forms. However, training semantic parsers
from weak supervision poses difficulties, and in addition, the generated
logical forms are only used as an intermediate step prior to retrieving
the denotation. In `this
paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02349.pdf>`__, it is presented TAPAS,
an approach to question answering over tables without generating logical
forms. TAPAS trains from weak supervision, and predicts the denotation
by selecting table cells and optionally applying a corresponding
aggregation operator to such selection. TAPAS extends BERT’s
architecture to encode tables as input, initializes from an effective
joint pre-training of text segments and tables crawled from Wikipedia,
and is trained end-to-end.

Use the original model to run an inference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



We use `this
example <https://huggingface.co/tasks/table-question-answering>`__ to
demonstrate how to make an inference. You can use ``pipeline`` from
``transformer`` library for this purpose.

.. code:: ipython3

    tqa = pipeline(task="table-question-answering", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
    result = tqa(table=table, query=question)
    print(f"The answer is {result['cells'][0]}")


.. parsed-literal::

    The answer is 53


You can read more about the inference output structure in `this
documentation <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/tapas>`__.

Convert the original model to OpenVINO Intermediate Representation (IR) format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



The original model is a PyTorch module, that can be converted with
``ov.convert_model`` function directly. We also use ``ov.save_model``
function to serialize the result of conversion.

.. code:: ipython3

    import openvino as ov
    from pathlib import Path


    # Define the input shape
    batch_size = 1
    sequence_length = 29

    # Modify the input shape of the dummy_input dictionary
    dummy_input = {
        "input_ids": torch.zeros((batch_size, sequence_length), dtype=torch.long),
        "attention_mask": torch.zeros((batch_size, sequence_length), dtype=torch.long),
        "token_type_ids": torch.zeros((batch_size, sequence_length, 7), dtype=torch.long),
    }


    ov_model_xml_path = Path('models/ov_model.xml')

    if not ov_model_xml_path.exists():
        ov_model = ov.convert_model(
            model,
            example_input=dummy_input
        )
        ov.save_model(ov_model, ov_model_xml_path)

Run the OpenVINO model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Select a device from dropdown list for running inference using OpenVINO.

.. code:: ipython3

    import ipywidgets as widgets

    core = ov.Core()

    device = widgets.Dropdown(
        options=core.available_devices + ["AUTO"],
        value='AUTO',
        description='Device:',
        disabled=False,
    )

    device




.. parsed-literal::

    Dropdown(description='Device:', index=1, options=('CPU', 'AUTO'), value='AUTO')



We use ``ov.compile_model`` to make it ready to use for loading on a
device. To prepare inputs use the original ``tokenizer``.

.. code:: ipython3

    inputs = tokenizer(table=table, queries=question, padding="max_length", return_tensors="pt")

    compiled_model = core.compile_model(ov_model_xml_path, device.value)
    result = compiled_model((inputs["input_ids"], inputs["attention_mask"], inputs["token_type_ids"]))

Now we should postprocess results. For this, we can use the appropriate
part of the code from
`postprocess <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/fe2877ce21eb75d34d30664757e2727d7eab817e/src/transformers/pipelines/table_question_answering.py#L393>`__
method of ``TableQuestionAnsweringPipeline``.

.. code:: ipython3

    logits = result[0]
    logits_aggregation = result[1]


    predictions = tokenizer.convert_logits_to_predictions(inputs, torch.from_numpy(result[0]))
    answer_coordinates_batch = predictions[0]
    aggregators = {}
    aggregators_prefix = {}
    answers = []
    for index, coordinates in enumerate(answer_coordinates_batch):
        cells = [table.iat[coordinate] for coordinate in coordinates]
        aggregator = aggregators.get(index, "")
        aggregator_prefix = aggregators_prefix.get(index, "")
        answer = {
            "answer": aggregator_prefix + ", ".join(cells),
            "coordinates": coordinates,
            "cells": [table.iat[coordinate] for coordinate in coordinates],
        }
        if aggregator:
            answer["aggregator"] = aggregator

        answers.append(answer)

    print(answers[0]["cells"][0])

Also, we can use the original pipeline. For this, we should create a
wrapper for ``TapasForQuestionAnswering`` class replacing ``forward``
method to use the OpenVINO model for inference and methods and
attributes of original model class to be integrated into the pipeline.

.. code:: ipython3

    from transformers import TapasConfig


    # get config for pretrained model
    config = TapasConfig.from_pretrained('google/tapas-large-finetuned-wtq')



    class TapasForQuestionAnswering(TapasForQuestionAnswering):  # it is better to keep the class name to avoid warnings
        def __init__(self, ov_model_path):
            super().__init__(config)  # pass config from the pretrained model
            self.tqa_model = core.compile_model(ov_model_path, device.value)

        def forward(self, input_ids, *, attention_mask, token_type_ids):
            results = self.tqa_model((input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids))

            return torch.from_numpy(results[0]), torch.from_numpy(results[1])


    compiled_model = TapasForQuestionAnswering(ov_model_xml_path)
    tqa = pipeline(task="table-question-answering", model=compiled_model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
    print(tqa(table=table, query=question)["cells"][0])
