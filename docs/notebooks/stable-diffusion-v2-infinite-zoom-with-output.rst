Infinite Zoom Stable Diffusion v2 and OpenVINO™
===============================================

Stable Diffusion v2 is the next generation of Stable Diffusion model a
Text-to-Image latent diffusion model created by the researchers and
engineers from `Stability AI <https://stability.ai/>`__ and
`LAION <https://laion.ai/>`__.

General diffusion models are machine learning systems that are trained
to denoise random gaussian noise step by step, to get to a sample of
interest, such as an image. Diffusion models have shown to achieve
state-of-the-art results for generating image data. But one downside of
diffusion models is that the reverse denoising process is slow. In
addition, these models consume a lot of memory because they operate in
pixel space, which becomes unreasonably expensive when generating
high-resolution images. Therefore, it is challenging to train these
models and also use them for inference. OpenVINO brings capabilities to
run model inference on Intel hardware and opens the door to the
fantastic world of diffusion models for everyone!

In previous notebooks, we already discussed how to run `Text-to-Image
generation and Image-to-Image generation using Stable Diffusion
v1 <stable-diffusion-text-to-image-with-output.html>`__
and `controlling its generation process using
ControlNet <controlnet-stable-diffusion-with-output.html>`__.
Now is turn of Stable Diffusion v2.

Stable Diffusion v2: What’s new?
--------------------------------

The new stable diffusion model offers a bunch of new features inspired
by the other models that have emerged since the introduction of the
first iteration. Some of the features that can be found in the new model
are:

-  The model comes with a new robust encoder, OpenCLIP, created by LAION
   and aided by Stability AI; this version v2 significantly enhances the
   produced photos over the V1 versions.
-  The model can now generate images in a 768x768 resolution, offering
   more information to be shown in the generated images.
-  The model finetuned with
   `v-objective <https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00512>`__. The
   v-parameterization is particularly useful for numerical stability
   throughout the diffusion process to enable progressive distillation
   for models. For models that operate at higher resolution, it is also
   discovered that the v-parameterization avoids color shifting
   artifacts that are known to affect high resolution diffusion models,
   and in the video setting it avoids temporal color shifting that
   sometimes appears with epsilon-prediction used in Stable Diffusion
   v1.
-  The model also comes with a new diffusion model capable of running
   upscaling on the images generated. Upscaled images can be adjusted up
   to 4 times the original image. Provided as separated model, for more
   details please check
   `stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler <https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler>`__
-  The model comes with a new refined depth architecture capable of
   preserving context from prior generation layers in an image-to-image
   setting. This structure preservation helps generate images that
   preserving forms and shadow of objects, but with different content.
-  The model comes with an updated inpainting module built upon the
   previous model. This text-guided inpainting makes switching out parts
   in the image easier than before.

This notebook demonstrates how to download the model from the Hugging
Face Hub and converted to OpenVINO IR format with `Optimum
Intel <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/inference#stable-diffusion>`__.
And how to use the model to generate sequence of images for infinite
zoom video effect.

Installation Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a self-contained example that relies solely on its own code.

We recommend running the notebook in a virtual environment. You only
need a Jupyter server to start. For details, please refer to
`Installation
Guide <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/blob/latest/README.md#-installation-guide>`__.

Stable Diffusion v2 Infinite Zoom Showcase
------------------------------------------



In this tutorial we consider how to use Stable Diffusion v2 model for
generation sequence of images for infinite zoom video effect. To do
this, we will need
`stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-inpainting <https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-inpainting>`__
model.

Stable Diffusion Text guided Inpainting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



In image editing, inpainting is a process of restoring missing parts of
pictures. Most commonly applied to reconstructing old deteriorated
images, removing cracks, scratches, dust spots, or red-eyes from
photographs.

But with the power of AI and the Stable Diffusion model, inpainting can
be used to achieve more than that. For example, instead of just
restoring missing parts of an image, it can be used to render something
entirely new in any part of an existing picture. Only your imagination
limits it.

The workflow diagram explains how Stable Diffusion inpainting pipeline
for inpainting works:

   :alt: sd2-inpainting

   sd2-inpainting

The pipeline has a lot of common with Text-to-Image generation pipeline
discussed in previous section. Additionally to text prompt, pipeline
accepts input source image and mask which provides an area of image
which should be modified. Masked image encoded by VAE encoder into
latent diffusion space and concatenated with randomly generated (on
initial step only) or produced by U-Net latent generated image
representation and used as input for next step denoising.

Using this inpainting feature, decreasing image by certain margin and
masking this border for every new frame we can create interesting Zoom
Out video based on our prompt.

Prerequisites

install required packages

.. code:: ipython3

    %pip install -q "diffusers>=0.14.0" "transformers>=4.25.1" "gradio>=4.19" "openvino>=2024.2.0" "torch>=2.1" Pillow opencv-python "git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel.git" --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

Load Stable Diffusion Inpaint pipeline using Optimum Intel
----------------------------------------------------------



We will load optimized Stable Diffusion model from the Hugging Face Hub
and create pipeline to run an inference with OpenVINO Runtime by
`Optimum
Intel <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/inference#stable-diffusion>`__.

For running the Stable Diffusion model with Optimum Intel, we will use
the optimum.intel.OVStableDiffusionInpaintPipeline class, which
represents the inference pipeline. OVStableDiffusionInpaintPipeline
initialized by the from_pretrained method. It supports on-the-fly
conversion models from PyTorch using the export=True parameter. A
converted model can be saved on disk using the save_pretrained method
for the next running.

Select device from dropdown list for running inference using OpenVINO.

Zoom Video Generation
---------------------



For achieving zoom effect, we will use inpainting to expand images
beyond their original borders. We run our
``OVStableDiffusionInpaintPipeline`` in the loop, where each next frame
will add edges to previous. The frame generation process illustrated on
diagram below:

.. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29454499/228739686-436f2759-4c79-42a2-a70f-959fb226834c.png
   :alt: frame generation)

   frame generation)

After processing current frame, we decrease size of current image by
mask size pixels from each side and use it as input for next step.
Changing size of mask we can influence the size of painting area and
image scaling.

There are 2 zooming directions:

-  Zoom Out - move away from object
-  Zoom In - move closer to object

Zoom In will be processed in the same way as Zoom Out, but after
generation is finished, we record frames in reversed order.
