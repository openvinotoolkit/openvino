LLM-powered chatbot using Stable-Zephyr-3b and OpenVINO
=======================================================

In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots
have become powerful tools for businesses to enhance customer
interactions and streamline operations. Large Language Models (LLMs) are
artificial intelligence systems that can understand and generate human
language. They use deep learning algorithms and massive amounts of data
to learn the nuances of language and produce coherent and relevant
responses. While a decent intent-based chatbot can answer basic,
one-touch inquiries like order management, FAQs, and policy questions,
LLM chatbots can tackle more complex, multi-touch questions. LLM enables
chatbots to provide support in a conversational manner, similar to how
humans do, through contextual memory. Leveraging the capabilities of
Language Models, chatbots are becoming increasingly intelligent, capable
of understanding and responding to human language with remarkable
accuracy.

``Stable Zephyr 3B`` is a 3 billion parameter model that demonstrated
outstanding results on many LLM evaluation benchmarks outperforming many
popular models in relatively small size. Inspired by `HugginFaceH4‚Äôs
Zephyr 7B <https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta>`__
training pipeline this model was trained on a mix of publicly available
datasets, synthetic datasets using `Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290>`__, evaluation for this model
based on `MT Bench <https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval/>`__ and
`Alpaca Benchmark <https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval/>`__. More
details about model can be found in `model
card <https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stablelm-zephyr-3b>`__

In this tutorial, we consider how to optimize and run this model using
the OpenVINO toolkit. For the convenience of the conversion step and
model performance evaluation, we will use
`llm_bench <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai/tree/master/llm_bench/python>`__
tool, which provides a unified approach to estimate performance for LLM.
It is based on pipelines provided by Optimum-Intel and allows to
estimate performance for Pytorch and OpenVINO models using almost the
same code. We also demonstrate how to make model stateful, that provides
opportunity for processing model cache state.

Convert model to OpenVINO Intermediate Representation (IR) and compress model weights to INT4 using NNCF
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



llm_bench provides conversion script for converting LLMS into OpenVINO
IR format compatible with Optimum-Intel. It also allows to compress
model weights into INT8 or INT4 precision with
`NNCF <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf>`__. For enabling weights
compression in INT4 we should use ``--compress_weights 4BIT_DEFAULT``
argument. The Weights Compression algorithm is aimed at compressing the
weights of the models and can be used to optimize the model footprint
and performance of large models where the size of weights is relatively
larger than the size of activations, for example, Large Language Models
(LLM). Compared to INT8 compression, INT4 compression improves
performance even more but introduces a minor drop in prediction quality.

    Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a young girl named Lily. She had two pets, a cat named Mittens and a dog named Max. Mittens was a beautiful black cat with green eyes, and Max was a big lovable golden retriever with a wagging tail.
    One sunny day, Lily decided to take Mittens and Max for a walk in the nearby forest. As they were walking, they heard a loud barking sound. Suddenly, a pack of dogs appeared from the bushes, led by a big brown dog with a friendly smile.
    Lily was scared and worried about her pets. She quickly remembered that she had a whistle that she used to train Max. She took a deep breath and blew the whistle.
    Max, who was trained to respond to the whistle, ran towards Lily and the dogs. The big brown dog approached Lily and introduced himself as Buddy.
    Lily was relieved and happy to see her pets safe and sound. She thanked Buddy for helping her and her pets.
    From that day on, Lily and Buddy became good friends. They often went on walks in the forest, and Buddy even learned to stay and wait while Lily played with Mittens.
    And so, Lily and Max and Buddy lived happily ever after, enjoying their time together in the forest.<|endoftext|>


Apply stateful transformation for automatic handling model state
----------------------------------------------------------------



Stable Zephyr is a decoder-only transformer model and generates text
token by token in an autoregressive fashion. Since the output side is
auto-regressive, an output token hidden state remains the same once
computed for every further generation step. Therefore, recomputing it
every time you want to generate a new token seems wasteful. To optimize
the generation process and use memory more efficiently, HuggingFace
transformers API provides a mechanism for caching model state externally
using ``use_cache=True`` parameter and ``past_key_values`` argument in
inputs and outputs. With the cache, the model saves the hidden state
once it has been computed. The model only computes the one for the most
recently generated output token at each time step, re-using the saved
ones for hidden tokens. This reduces the generation complexity from
:math:`O(n^3)` to :math:`O(n^2)` for a transformer model. With this
option, the model gets the previous step‚Äôs hidden states (cached
attention keys and values) as input and additionally provides hidden
states for the current step as output. It means for all next iterations,
it is enough to provide only a new token obtained from the previous step
and cached key values to get the next token prediction.

With increasing model size like in modern LLMs, we also can note an
increase in the number of attention blocks and size past key values
tensors respectively. The strategy for handling cache state as model
inputs and outputs in the inference cycle may become a bottleneck for
memory-bounded systems, especially with processing long input sequences,
for example in a chatbot scenario. OpenVINO suggests a transformation
that removes inputs and corresponding outputs with cache tensors from
the model keeping cache handling logic inside the model. Hiding the
cache enables storing and updating the cache values in a more
device-friendly representation. It helps to reduce memory consumption
and additionally optimize model performance.

You can estimate the model performance by adding stateful transformation
using ``--stateful`` flag on conversion step

.. code:: ipython3

    stateful_model_path = Path("stable-zephyr-3b-stateful/pytorch/dldt/compressed_weights/OV_FP16-4BIT_DEFAULT")

Using model with Optimum Intel
------------------------------



Running model with Optimum-Intel API required following steps: 1.
register normalized config for model 2. create instance of
``OVModelForCausalLM`` class using ``from_pretrained`` method and
providing path to the model and ``stateful`` flag

The model text generation interface remains without changes, the text
generation process started with running ``ov_model.generate`` method and
passing text encoded by the tokenizer as input. This method returns a
sequence of generated token ids that should be decoded using a tokenizer

Interactive chatbot demo
------------------------



| Now, our model ready to use. Let‚Äôs see it in action. We will use
  Gradio interface for interaction with model. Put text message into
  ``Chat message box`` and click ``Submit`` button for starting
  conversation. There are several parameters that can control text
  generation quality: \* ``Temperature`` is a parameter used to control
  the level of creativity in AI-generated text. By adjusting the
  ``temperature``, you can influence the AI model‚Äôs probability
  distribution, making the text more focused or diverse.
| Consider the following example: The AI model has to complete the
  sentence ‚ÄúThe cat is \____.‚Äù with the following token probabilities:

::

   playing: 0.5  
   sleeping: 0.25  
   eating: 0.15  
   driving: 0.05  
   flying: 0.05  

   - **Low temperature** (e.g., 0.2): The AI model becomes more focused and deterministic, choosing tokens with the highest probability, such as "playing."  
   - **Medium temperature** (e.g., 1.0): The AI model maintains a balance between creativity and focus, selecting tokens based on their probabilities without significant bias, such as "playing," "sleeping," or "eating."  
   - **High temperature** (e.g., 2.0): The AI model becomes more adventurous, increasing the chances of selecting less likely tokens, such as "driving" and "flying."

-  ``Top-p``, also known as nucleus sampling, is a parameter used to
   control the range of tokens considered by the AI model based on their
   cumulative probability. By adjusting the ``top-p`` value, you can
   influence the AI model‚Äôs token selection, making it more focused or
   diverse. Using the same example with the cat, consider the following
   top_p settings:

   -  **Low top_p** (e.g., 0.5): The AI model considers only tokens with
      the highest cumulative probability, such as ‚Äúplaying.‚Äù
   -  **Medium top_p** (e.g., 0.8): The AI model considers tokens with a
      higher cumulative probability, such as ‚Äúplaying,‚Äù ‚Äúsleeping,‚Äù and
      ‚Äúeating.‚Äù
   -  **High top_p** (e.g., 1.0): The AI model considers all tokens,
      including those with lower probabilities, such as ‚Äúdriving‚Äù and
      ‚Äúflying.‚Äù

-  ``Top-k`` is an another popular sampling strategy. In comparison with
   Top-P, which chooses from the smallest possible set of words whose
   cumulative probability exceeds the probability P, in Top-K sampling K
   most likely next words are filtered and the probability mass is
   redistributed among only those K next words. In our example with cat,
   if k=3, then only ‚Äúplaying‚Äù, ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù and ‚Äúeating‚Äù will be taken
   into account as possible next word.
-  ``Repetition Penalty`` This parameter can help penalize tokens based
   on how frequently they occur in the text, including the input prompt.
   A token that has already appeared five times is penalized more
   heavily than a token that has appeared only one time. A value of 1
   means that there is no penalty and values larger than 1 discourage
   repeated tokens.

You can modify them in ``Advanced generation options`` section.
