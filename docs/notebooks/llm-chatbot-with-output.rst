Create an LLM-powered Chatbot using OpenVINO
============================================

In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots
have emerged as powerful tools for businesses to enhance customer
interactions and streamline operations. Large Language Models (LLMs) are
artificial intelligence systems that can understand and generate human
language. They use deep learning algorithms and massive amounts of data
to learn the nuances of language and produce coherent and relevant
responses. While a decent intent-based chatbot can answer basic,
one-touch inquiries like order management, FAQs, and policy questions,
LLM chatbots can tackle more complex, multi-touch questions. LLM enables
chatbots to provide support in a conversational manner, similar to how
humans do, through contextual memory. Leveraging the capabilities of
Language Models, chatbots are becoming increasingly intelligent, capable
of understanding and responding to human language with remarkable
accuracy.

Previously, we already discussed how to build an instruction-following
pipeline using OpenVINO and Optimum Intel, please check out `Dolly
example <dolly-2-instruction-following-with-output.html>`__ for reference. In this
tutorial, we consider how to use the power of OpenVINO for running Large
Language Models for chat. We will use a pre-trained model from the
`Hugging Face
Transformers <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index>`__
library. To simplify the user experience, the `Hugging Face Optimum
Intel <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/index>`__ library is
used to convert the models to OpenVINO™ IR format and to create
inference pipeline. The inference pipeline can also be created using
`OpenVINO Generate
API <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai/tree/master/src>`__,
the example of that, please, see in the notebook `LLM chatbot with
OpenVINO Generate API <llm-chatbot-generate-api-with-output.html>`__

The tutorial consists of the following steps:

-  Install prerequisites
-  Download and convert the model from a public source using the
   `OpenVINO integration with Hugging Face
   Optimum <https://huggingface.co/blog/openvino>`__.
-  Compress model weights to 4-bit or 8-bit data types using
   `NNCF <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf>`__
-  Create a chat inference pipeline
-  Run chat pipeline

Convert model using Optimum-CLI tool
------------------------------------



`Optimum Intel <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/index>`__ is
the interface between the
`Transformers <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index>`__ and
`Diffusers <https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index>`__ libraries
and OpenVINO to accelerate end-to-end pipelines on Intel architectures.
It provides ease-to-use cli interface for exporting models to `OpenVINO
Intermediate Representation
(IR) <https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/documentation/openvino-ir-format.html>`__
format.

The command bellow demonstrates basic command for model export with
``optimum-cli``

::

   optimum-cli export openvino --model <model_id_or_path> --task <task> <out_dir>

where ``--model`` argument is model id from HuggingFace Hub or local
directory with model (saved using ``.save_pretrained`` method),
``--task`` is one of `supported
task <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/exporters/task_manager>`__
that exported model should solve. For LLMs it will be
``text-generation-with-past``. If model initialization requires to use
remote code, ``--trust-remote-code`` flag additionally should be passed.

Compress model weights
----------------------

The `Weights
Compression <https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/openvino-workflow/model-optimization-guide/weight-compression.html>`__
algorithm is aimed at compressing the weights of the models and can be
used to optimize the model footprint and performance of large models
where the size of weights is relatively larger than the size of
activations, for example, Large Language Models (LLM). Compared to INT8
compression, INT4 compression improves performance even more, but
introduces a minor drop in prediction quality.

Weights Compression using Optimum-CLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



You can also apply fp16, 8-bit or 4-bit weight compression on the
Linear, Convolutional and Embedding layers when exporting your model
with the CLI by setting ``--weight-format`` to respectively fp16, int8
or int4. This type of optimization allows to reduce the memory footprint
and inference latency. By default the quantization scheme for int8/int4
will be
`asymmetric <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/blob/develop/docs/compression_algorithms/Quantization.md#asymmetric-quantization>`__,
to make it
`symmetric <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/blob/develop/docs/compression_algorithms/Quantization.md#symmetric-quantization>`__
you can add ``--sym``.

For INT4 quantization you can also specify the following arguments:

-
The ``--group-size`` parameter will define the group size to use for
quantization, -1 it will results in per-column quantization. - The
``--ratio`` parameter controls the ratio between 4-bit and 8-bit
quantization. If set to 0.9, it means that 90% of the layers will be
quantized to int4 while 10% will be quantized to int8.

Smaller group_size and ratio values usually improve accuracy at the
sacrifice of the model size and inference latency.

   **Note**: There may be no speedup for INT4/INT8 compressed models on
   dGPU.

.. code:: ipython3

    from IPython.display import Markdown, display

    prepare_int4_model = widgets.Checkbox(
        value=True,
        description="Prepare INT4 model",

Weight compression with AWQ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



`Activation-aware Weight
Quantization <https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00978>`__ (AWQ) is an algorithm
that tunes model weights for more accurate INT4 compression. It slightly
improves generation quality of compressed LLMs, but requires significant
additional time for tuning weights on a calibration dataset. We use
``wikitext-2-raw-v1/train`` subset of the
`Wikitext <https://huggingface.co/datasets/Salesforce/wikitext>`__
dataset for calibration.

Below you can enable AWQ to be additionally applied during model export
with INT4 precision.

   **Note**: Applying AWQ requires significant memory and time.

..

   **Note**: It is possible that there will be no matching patterns in
   the model to apply AWQ, in such case it will be skipped.

.. code:: ipython3

    enable_awq = widgets.Checkbox(
        value=False,
        description="Enable AWQ",
        disabled=not prepare_int4_model.value,
    )
    display(enable_awq)



.. parsed-literal::

    Checkbox(value=False, description='Enable AWQ')


We can now save floating point and compressed model variants

Instantiate Model using Optimum Intel
-------------------------------------



Optimum Intel can be used to load optimized models from the `Hugging
Face Hub <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/hf.co/models>`__ and
create pipelines to run an inference with OpenVINO Runtime using Hugging
Face APIs. The Optimum Inference models are API compatible with Hugging
Face Transformers models. This means we just need to replace
``AutoModelForXxx`` class with the corresponding ``OVModelForXxx``
class.

Below is an example of the RedPajama model

.. code:: diff

   -from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
   +from optimum.intel.openvino import OVModelForCausalLM
   from transformers import AutoTokenizer, pipeline

   model_id = "togethercomputer/RedPajama-INCITE-Chat-3B-v1"
   -model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)
   +model = OVModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, export=True)

Model class initialization starts with calling ``from_pretrained``
method. When downloading and converting Transformers model, the
parameter ``export=True`` should be added (as we already converted model
before, we do not need to provide this parameter). We can save the
converted model for the next usage with the ``save_pretrained`` method.
Tokenizer class and pipelines API are compatible with Optimum models.

You can find more details about OpenVINO LLM inference using HuggingFace
Optimum API in `LLM inference
guide <https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/learn-openvino/llm_inference_guide.html>`__.

Run Chatbot

Now, when model created, we can setup Chatbot interface using
`Gradio <https://www.gradio.app/>`__. The diagram below illustrates how
the chatbot pipeline works

   :alt: generation pipeline

   generation pipeline

As can be seen, the pipeline very similar to instruction-following with
only changes that previous conversation history additionally passed as
input with next user question for getting wider input context. On the
first iteration, the user provided instructions joined to conversation
history (if exists) converted to token ids using a tokenizer, then
prepared input provided to the model. The model generates probabilities
for all tokens in logits format The way the next token will be selected
over predicted probabilities is driven by the selected decoding
methodology. You can find more information about the most popular
decoding methods in this
`blog <https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate>`__. The result
generation updates conversation history for next conversation step. it
makes stronger connection of next question with previously provided and
allows user to make clarifications regarding previously provided
answers.https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/learn-openvino/llm_inference_guide.html

| There are several parameters that can control text generation quality:
  \* ``Temperature`` is a parameter used to control the level of

  can influence the AI model’s probability distribution, making the text
  more focused or diverse.

   - **Low temperature** (e.g., 0.2): The AI model becomes more focused and deterministic, choosing tokens with the highest probability, such as "playing."
   - **Medium temperature** (e.g., 1.0): The AI model maintains a balance between creativity and focus, selecting tokens based on their probabilities without significant bias, such as "playing," "sleeping," or "eating."
   - **High temperature** (e.g., 2.0): The AI model becomes more adventurous, increasing the chances of selecting less likely tokens, such as "driving" and "flying."

-  ``Top-p``, also known as nucleus sampling, is a parameter used to
   control the range of tokens considered by the AI model based on their
   cumulative probability. By adjusting the ``top-p`` value, you can
   influence the AI model’s token selection, making it more focused or
   diverse. Using the same example with the cat, consider the following
   top_p settings:

   -  **Low top_p** (e.g., 0.5): The AI model considers only tokens with
      the highest cumulative probability, such as “playing.”
   -  **Medium top_p** (e.g., 0.8): The AI model considers tokens with a
      higher cumulative probability, such as “playing,” “sleeping,” and
      “eating.”
   -  **High top_p** (e.g., 1.0): The AI model considers all tokens,
      including those with lower probabilities, such as “driving” and
      “flying.”

-  ``Top-k`` is an another popular sampling strategy. In comparison with
   Top-P, which chooses from the smallest possible set of words whose
   cumulative probability exceeds the probability P, in Top-K sampling K
   most likely next words are filtered and the probability mass is
   redistributed among only those K next words. In our example with cat,
   if k=3, then only “playing”, “sleeping” and “eating” will be taken
   into account as possible next word.
-  ``Repetition Penalty`` This parameter can help penalize tokens based
   on how frequently they occur in the text, including the input prompt.
   A token that has already appeared five times is penalized more
   heavily than a token that has appeared only one time. A value of 1
   means that there is no penalty and values larger than 1 discourage
   repeated
   tokens.https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/learn-openvino/llm_inference_guide.html

Besides chatbot, we can use LangChain to augmenting LLM knowledge with
additional data, which allow you to build AI applications that can
reason about private data or data introduced after a model’s cutoff
date. You can find this solution in `Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) example <-with-output.html>`__.
