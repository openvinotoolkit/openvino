# Available Operations Sets {#openvino_docs_ops_opset}

According to capabilities of supported deep learning frameworks and hardware capabilities of a target inference device, all operations are combined into operations sets each fully supported in a specific version of OpenVINO™ toolkit. 

This topic provides a complete list of available sets of operations supported in different versions of OpenVINO™ toolkit. It's highly recommended to use the actual version of the operations set for a particular release. For a list of operations included into an operations set, click a link in the table.
