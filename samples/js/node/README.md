# OpenVINO™ JavaScript API examples of usage

## Installation of openvino-node package
From *openvino/src/bindings/js/node* run `npm i` to download OpenVINO™ runtime, install requirements, build bindings and compile TypeScript code to JavaScript

On the *.nix systems run `source openvino/src/bindings/js/node/scripts/setupvars.sh` to add path to OpenVINO™ runtime libraries in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable

Note: Perform these steps also before running notebooks.
