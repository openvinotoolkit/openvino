 * @brief Holds weightless caching attributes of a single constant.
 *
 * WeightlessCacheAttribute class represents runtime info attribute that holds
 * the values of original size of the constant in bytes and the binary offset of the
 * constant's data in the weights file used by the weightless caching mechanism. It's
 * not copyable in case the data was changed (the original node was replaced by a new
 * one produced during the tranformation pipeline) - in that case weightless caching
 * can't be used for that constant.
