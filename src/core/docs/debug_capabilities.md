# OpenVINO Core debug capabilities

OpenVINO Core contains a set of different debug capabilities that make developer life easier by collecting information about object statuses during OpenVINO Runtime execution and reporting this information to the developer.

* OpenVINO Model debug capabilities are described in the [OpenVINO Model User Guide](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/openvino-workflow/running-inference/model-representation.html#model-debug-capabilities).
