# OpenVINO UV Compatibility Guide

## Overview

OpenVINO is now compatible with UV package manager and modern PEP 735 dependency groups. 

**Important Migration Notice:**
- **Recommended**: Use dependency groups defined in `pyproject.toml` with pip 25.1+ or UV
- **Deprecated**: `requirements.txt` and `constraints.txt` files will be removed after a migration period
  


Dependencies are available through both traditional requirements.txt files (deprecated and set to be removed in OpenVINO XX.X) and modern PEP 735 dependency groups (recommended).



## Why migrate to UV?

UV is recommended for dependency management because:

- **Speed**: UV installs dependencies much faster than pip by using a Rust-based resolver and installer.
- **Reliability**: UV provides more consistent and reproducible installs, reducing dependency conflicts and resolver errors.
- **PEP 735 Support**: UV natively supports dependency groups, making it easier to manage complex project requirements.
- **Modern Python Packaging**: UV is designed for modern workflows and works seamlessly with `pyproject.toml`.

While pip 25.1+ also supports dependency groups, UV is preferred for its performance and reliability, especially in CI/CD and developer environments.

## Mapping: Requirements Files â†’ Dependency Groups

### Migration Examples

**Before (requirements files):**
```bash
pip install -r src/bindings/python/wheel/requirements-dev.txt
pip install -r tests/layer_tests/requirements.txt
pip install -r src/frontends/onnx/tests/requirements.txt
```

**After (dependency groups):**
```bash
# Using UV (recommended)
uv pip install --group dev_wheel --group tests_layer --group tests_onnx_frontend

# Using pip 25.1+
pip install --group dev_wheel --group tests_layer --group tests_onnx_frontend
```


| Old Command | New Command | Description |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| `pip install -r src/bindings/python/wheel/requirements-dev.txt` | `uv pip install --group dev_wheel` | Install build tools |
| `pip install -r src/bindings/python/requirements_test.txt` | `uv pip install --group tests_pyapi` | Install test/lint tools |
| `pip install -r src/bindings/python/requirements.txt` | `uv pip install --group runtime` | Install runtime deps |
