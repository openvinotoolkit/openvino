# OpenVINO™ Paddle Frontend

OpenVINO Paddle Frontend is one of the OpenVINO Frontend libraries created for the Baidu PaddlePaddle™ framework.
The component is responsible for:
 * Paddle Reader - reads a PaddlePaddle protobuf model and parses it to the frontend InputModel. [Learn more about Paddle Frontend architecture.](./docs/paddle_frontend_architecture.md).
 * Paddle Converter - decodes a PaddlePaddle model and operators and maps them semantically to the OpenVINO opset. [Learn more about the operator mapping flow.](./docs/operation_mapping_flow.md).

OpenVINO Paddle Frontend uses [the common coding style rules](../../../docs/dev/coding_style.md).
