NotSet - not part of a fusing chain

IgnoredAfterInputs - node must be skipped, since can't be handled properly at this time. Also a continuable fusing chain.

//  (in other words after tokenization). To handle this behavior, eltwise chains that start at input are marked as IgnoredAfterInputs.
//  Tis is not a real plugin-side fusing, but rather a workaround to guarantee that snippets always executed in FP32.
