# OpenVINO Inference API

OpenVINO Inference API contains two folders:
 * [ie](../include/ie/) - legacy API, this API is no longer being developed,
 * [openvino](../include/openvino/) - current public API, this part is described below.

## Components of Public OpenVINO Inference API

Public OpenVINO Inference API defines global header [openvino/openvino.hpp](../include/openvino/openvino.hpp) which includes all common OpenVINO headers. 
All Inference components are placed inside the [openvino/runtime](../include/openvino/runtime) folder.

To learn more about the Inference API usage, read [How to integrate OpenVINO with your application](https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.3/openvino_docs_OV_UG_Integrate_OV_with_your_application.html).
The diagram with dependencies is presented on the [OpenVINO Architecture page](../../docs/architecture.md#openvino-inference-pipeline).

## Components of OpenVINO Developer API

OpenVINO Developer API is required for OpenVINO plugin development. This process is described in the [OpenVINO Plugin Development Guide](https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.3/openvino_docs_ie_plugin_dg_overview.html).
