# Cyberspore Hybrid Setup Guide

## Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Local Infection (VS Code)
\\\ash
python local_runner.py
\\\

This:
- Checks your Gemma model
- Injects TSSN layers
- Creates \gemma_ir_tssn/\ folder
- Takes ~2 minutes

### Step 2: Submit to Colab
\\\ash
python submit_to_colab.py
\\\

This:
- Generates \Cyberspore_Evolution_Remote.ipynb\
- Shows you next steps
- Takes ~1 minute

### Step 3: Run on Colab
1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com
2. Upload the notebook (\Cyberspore_Evolution_Remote.ipynb\)
3. Upload your \gemma_ir_tssn\ folder to Google Drive
4. Run all cells
5. Download results when done

## What's Happening

### Local (Your Machine)
- \local_runner.py\ - Runs the fast infection
- Edits scripts, debugging
- NO heavy computation

### Remote (Colab)
- \Cyberspore_Evolution_Remote.ipynb\ - Runs the evolution loop
- Uses Colab's T4 GPU + 12GB RAM
- No time limit on free tier for first-time submissions
- Results saved to Google Drive

## Why This Is Better

| Task | Local | Colab |
|------|-------|-------|
| Edit scripts | ⚡ Fast | ❌ Slow |
| Test infection | ⚡ Fast | ❌ Slow |
| Run evolution | ❌ Slow (8GB RAM) | ⚡ Fast (12GB RAM) |

You do the fast stuff locally, Colab does the heavy lifting.

## Troubleshooting

### "Error: Infected model not found"
- Run \python local_runner.py\ first
- Check that \gemma_ir_tssn/openvino_model.xml\ exists

### "Evolution stalled on Colab"
- Check the notebook output for errors
- If it's just slow, wait—it could be running in background
- Save a checkpoint in Colab and download it

### "Results didn't save to Drive"
- Make sure you mounted Drive in the Colab cell
- Check your Drive's \/MyDrive/Cyberspore/results/\ folder

## Pro Tips

1. **Edit locally, run remotely** - Use VS Code to modify scripts, Colab to execute
2. **Check progress on Drive** - Colab saves checkpoints every N generations
3. **Reuse the notebook** - You can rerun it multiple times without re-uploading everything
4. **Monitor from VS Code** - Keep VS Code open and refresh the Drive folder to see progress

---

## Advanced: Run Multiple Jobs on Colab

Once you're comfortable with one evolution run, you can:
1. Modify \volve_gemma_v4_steady_state.py\ locally (different hyperparameters)
2. Run \submit_to_colab.py\ again (generates a new notebook)
3. Upload and run multiple Colab notebooks in parallel
4. Compare results locally

---

## File Locations

After running:
- \gemma_ir/\ - Original Gemma model (stay intact)
- \gemma_ir_tssn/\ - Infected model (generated by local_runner.py)
- \Cyberspore_Evolution_Remote.ipynb\ - Colab notebook (generated by submit_to_colab.py)
- \/MyDrive/Cyberspore/results/\ - Evolution results (saved by Colab)

---

## Next Steps

1. \python local_runner.py\
2. \python submit_to_colab.py\
3. Go to Colab and follow the instructions
