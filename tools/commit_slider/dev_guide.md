To face the user case we should clarify some aspects.

- Customization of existing Mode / creating a new one.
- The way of linking/compilation of main app.

- Do we need some preparation (collecting of specific data, validation of hardware behaviour, code preprocessing) ?
- Validation of result.
- API design.
