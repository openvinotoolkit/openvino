# [OpenVINO™ Toolkit](https://01.org/openvinotoolkit) - Deep Learning Deployment Toolkit repository
[![Stable release](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-2020.3-green.svg)](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/releases/tag/2020.3.0)
[![Apache License Version 2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache_2.0-green.svg)](LICENSE)

This toolkit allows developers to deploy pre-trained deep learning models 
through a high-level C++ Inference Engine API integrated with application logic. 

This open source version includes two components: namely [Model Optimizer] and 
[Inference Engine], as well as CPU, GPU and heterogeneous plugins to accelerate 
deep learning inferencing on Intel® CPUs and Intel® Processor Graphics. 
It supports pre-trained models from the [Open Model Zoo], along with 100+ open 
source and public models in popular formats such as Caffe\*, TensorFlow\*, 
MXNet\* and ONNX\*. 

## Repository components:
* [Inference Engine]
* [Model Optimizer]
